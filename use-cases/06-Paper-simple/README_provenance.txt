06-StackOverflow-simple-ringo.py <src directory> <output file>
Sample command: python 06-StackOverflow-simple-ringo.py . experts.tsv
	This is the ringo translation of 06-StackOverflow-simple-snap.py. Takes two parameters: the
	directory where the two input files ('posts.tsv' and 'tags.tsv') are located and the file to
	which the output is written to. The ouput consists of an ordered list of the experts in
	Python in the StackOverflow dataset. The program also prints (to stdout) the amount of time
	each operation takes. At the end of the execution, it outputs information to stdout. First, it
	dumps the first 20 rows of the result table (ringo.DumpTableContent), then it outputs the
	table's metadata (ringo.ShowMetadata). It finally outputs the table's dependencies in two
	different format (ringo.ShowDependencies).

06-StackOverflow-simple-provenance.py <src directory> <output file>
Sample command: python 06-StackOverflow-simple-ringo.py . experts.tsv
	This file is nearly identical to -simple-ringo.py. The only difference is that instead of
	outputting the final table's dependencies at the end, it generates a provenance script for
	that final table and places it in 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py 

06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py <posts.tsv src file> <tags.tsv src file> <output file>
NOTE: all inputs are optional
Sample Command: python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv experts.tsv
	This file is the automatically generated provenance script from a run of -simple-provenance.py.
	It needs the line 'import ringo' to work to run, and the input files to be correctly specified
	(as is, it looks for the input files in a directory named 'input/' by default). It will not
	generate any output, however.

06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen+edits.py <posts.tsv src file> <tags.tsv src file> <output file>
NOTE: all inputs are optional
Sample Command: python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv experts.tsv
	This file is nearly identical to the autogenerated provenance script - it has a few edits though.
	It has a few sys.path calls to make all of the importing work more nicely, and it outpouts the
	first 20 lines of the result table as well as the table's metadata.

06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen+modify.py <posts.tsv src file> <tags.tsv src file> <output file>
NOTE: all inputs are optional
Sample Command: python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv
		python 06-StackOverflow-simple-autogen.py posts.tsv tags.tsv experts.tsv
	This file is nearly identical to -simple-autogen+edits.py, except that the select statement
	is done with the condition 'Tag = java' instead of 'Tag = python'; the script now computes
	the Java experts in the StackOverflow dataset. It demonstrates the ease of changing the provenance
	script.
