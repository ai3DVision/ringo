- Check what happens with two different kinds of nodes (conflicting IDs/tuples?)
- Change implementation: merge NodeDescription and EdgeDescription together. In the end, call

    makegraph(starttable,gdesc,srccol,destcol,nodeattr,edgeattr)

Create programs, run them
See if the program is useful!! (more graph examples?)
Try to check the speed - ~10Mb/s would be ok
Don't care about data formatting (?? but still work with TSV files - make your life easy)
