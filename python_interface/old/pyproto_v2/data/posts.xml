You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number. This can be done with the naturals (obviously) and the complete range of integers (including negative numbers) and even the rational numbers (so including fractions). It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digits&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list. The same process can then be done again to show the list still isn't complete.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This shows a difference between two obviously infinite sets and leads to the somewhat scary conclusion that there are (at least) 2 different forms of infinity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="35" LastActivityDate="2010-07-20T19:23:17.570" />

If &lt;code&gt;f(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; represents the height of a point at &lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;∇f(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; represents the steepest incline from that point.  Or rather, if you placed a ball on that point, it would &lt;em&gt;start rolling in the opposite direction of the gradient vector&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, for multi-dimensional functions, it is easiest to find the derivative along an axis (x, y, z, etc.).

They are are also space efficient (three numbers). However, it is more difficult to linear interpolate values. Consider the case where you want to interpolate between 359 and 0 degrees. Linearly interpolating would cause a large rotation, even though the two orientations are almost the same. Writing shortest path interpolation, is easy for one axis, but non-trivial when considering the three Euler angles(for instance the shortest route between (240, 57, 145) and (35, -233, -270) is not immediately clear).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rotation matrices specify a new frame of reference using three normalized and orthogonal vectors (Right, Up, Out, which when multiplied become the new x, y, z). Rotation matrices are useful for operations like strafing (side ways movement), which only requires translating along the Right vector of the camera's rotation matrix. However, there is no clear method of interpolating between them. The are also expensive to normalize which is necessary to prevent scaling from being introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Axis angle, as the name suggests, are a way of specifying a rotation axis and angle to rotate around that axis. You can think of Euler angles, as three axis angle rotations, where the axises are the x, y, z axis respectively. Linearly interpolating the angle in a axis angle is pretty straight forward (if you remember to take the shortest path), however linearly interpolating between different axises is not. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quaternions are a way of specifying a rotation through a axis and the cosine of half the angle. They main advantage is I can pick any two quaternions and smoothly interpolate between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rotors are another way to perform rotations. Rotors are basically quaternions, but instead of thinking of them as 4D complex numbers, rotors are thought of as real 3D multivectors. This makes their visualization much more understandable (compared to quaternions), but requires fluency in geometric algebra to grasp their significance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay with that as the background I can discuss a real world example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Say you are writing a computer game&#xA;  where the characters are animated in&#xA;  3ds Max.

The animation is going to&#xA;  be represented as a list of rotations&#xA;  for each joint. How should we store&#xA;  the rotations? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If I am going to sample every frame,&#xA;  not interpolate, and space is not an&#xA;  issue, I would probably store the&#xA;  rotations as rotation matrices. If&#xA;  space was issue, then Euler angles.&#xA;  That would also let me do things like&#xA;  only store one angle for joints like&#xA;  the knee that have only one degree of&#xA;  freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If I only sampled every 4 frames, and&#xA;  need to interpolate it depends on&#xA;  whether I am sure the frame-rate will&#xA;  hold. If I am positive that the&#xA;  frame-rate will hold I can use axis&#xA;  angle relative rotations to perform&#xA;  the interpolation.

We need to understand that it isn't uncommon for one word to have different meanings for different groups of people - after all words mean whatever we make them mean. Most people only need to real world quantities, so they find it convenient to call those numbers. On the other hand, mathematicians explore a variety of different number systems. Indeed some, such as complex numbers, are useful for solving problems that are actually about real numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So mathematicians define i as a number that obeys most of the normal algebraic laws. They also defined i*i to equal -1. From this we can derive all of the standard results about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;complex number&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for whether they are real - it depends on what you want to know.

Aside from the&#xA;  cost and inconvenience of making you&#xA;  buy every function that you need&#xA;  separately, the Matlab design means&#xA;  that the core is inherently low level&#xA;  (since it cannot call on any of the&#xA;  toolbox functionality in case you have&#xA;  not purchased that toolbox), and many&#xA;  of these functions do not fit well&#xA;  together (e.g. no toolbox function can&#xA;  be used with symbolic parameters as&#xA;  they are all written using the&#xA;  numeric-only Matlab core).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Matlab's only comparative strength&#xA;  lies in some of its specialist&#xA;  toolboxes (e.g. control theory where&#xA;  it is dominant) but if you are not in&#xA;  that specialism, those are of no use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some specific differences between the&#xA;  core systems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab is machine precision numeric only with some support for complex&#xA;  arithmetic - all Mathematica functions&#xA;  support machine precision and&#xA;  arbitrary precision real and complex&#xA;  arithmetic, exact arithmetic and&#xA;  symbolic computation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab basic data model is 2D (matrices) with a pointer mechanism to&#xA;  emulate higher dimensions -&#xA;  Mathematica basic data model handles&#xA;  any dimensionality without extra work.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Many of Mathematica's functions switch automatically between different&#xA;  algorithms (with a manual overide) -&#xA;  in Matlab you must always choose the&#xA;  algorithm.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab requires you to manually linearize ODEs to a system of first&#xA;  order equations before it can solve&#xA;  them - Mathematica accepts any order&#xA;  ODE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab can do integration up to only three dimensions (with&#xA;  triplequad) Mathematica handles&#xA;  n-dimensional integration for any n.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab's language is procedural only (rather like higher level&#xA;  FORTRAN) - Mathematica allows&#xA;  programming in procedural, functional,&#xA;  object oriented and rule based styles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Matlab has text interface and a basic home grown IDE - Mathematica has&#xA;  text interface, document interface,&#xA;  GUI tools, and full Eclipse based IDE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-08-16T07:10:58.270" LastActivityDate="2010-08-16T07:10:58.270" CommentCount="8" />

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\prod (x+\zeta_p^iy) = z^p$ for $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$.  So if $p&gt;3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these &quot;generalized integers&quot; $Z[\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found.

The first question you have to ask yourself is &lt;em&gt;where you're working&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, addition and multiplication are defined on a &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt;, which in this case  is a &lt;em&gt;set&lt;/em&gt; (basically a collection of &quot;things&quot;) with two &lt;em&gt;operators&lt;/em&gt; we call &lt;em&gt;addition&lt;/em&gt; (marked $+$) and &lt;em&gt;multiplication&lt;/em&gt; (marked $\cdot$ or $\times$ or $\ast$ or whatever). If this structure holds some properties, which are sometimes called &lt;em&gt;axioms&lt;/em&gt;, then it is called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_ring&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;unit ring&lt;/a&gt;. The properties are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The set is closed under the operator $+$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a+b$ is also in $R$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The set has a member which we mark as $0$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a+0 = 0$ and $0+a = 0$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The operation $+$ is commutative: $a+b = b+a$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The operation $+$ is associative: $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every member has an additive inverse: for every $a$ in $R$ there is some $b$ in $R$ such that $a+b = 0$ (we mark $b$ as $-a$).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The set is closed under the operator $*$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a*b$ is also in $R$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The set has a member which we mark as $1$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a*1 = a$ and $1*a = a$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The operation $*$ is associative: $(a*b) * c = a * (b*c)$.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multiplication is distributive over addition: $a * (b+c) = a*b + a*c$ and $(a+b) * c = a*b + a*c$. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this is a long list, and introduces the operator $+$ which is not even explicitly mentioned in the question, these properties are quite natural. For example, the integers $\{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$ we all know and love indeed form a ring. The real numbers also form a ring  (in fact they form a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;, which means they hold even more properties).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regard to your question, the identity $x * 1 = x$ (I assume that's what you meant) is in fact an axiom - it is axiom 7. However, the other two identities are results of the other axioms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First identity:&lt;/strong&gt; We use axioms 2 and 9 to get  $0 * x = (0+0) * x = 0*x + 0*x$  and then by adding $-(0*x)$ (the additive inverse of $0*x$, from axiom 5) to both sides,  $0 = 0*x$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second identity:&lt;/strong&gt; As stated in axiom 5, $-(-x)$ is just a notation used which means &quot;the additive inverse of $-x$&quot;. To show that $-(-x) = x$ we need to show that $x$ is in fact the additive inverse of $-x$, or in other words that $x + -x = 0$ and $-x + x = 0$. But that's just what axiom 5 says, so we're done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last point: You might be wondering why did we have to go and introduce addition to answer a question about multiplication? Well, it so happens that without addition the other two identities are simply not true. For example, if we look at the positive integers $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ with only multiplication, then there is no $0$ there!

Numbers are what you get when you look at collections of objects and &lt;em&gt;forget what kind of object they are&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you say &quot;as sets&quot; you mean you're forgetting a lot of information, in particular you don't care about what the names of the elements in that set are or what properties those elements have.

Depending on how you want to measure &quot;size of a subset of the natural numbers&quot; they might be different sizes.  For example, a common way to measure &quot;size of a subset of the natural numbers&quot; is by its &quot;density.&quot;  That is you look at the first N numbers and calculate what fraction of them are in your set, and then take the limit as N goes to infinity (warning for sufficiently complicated sets this limit might not exist).  So for your two examples, one has density 1 and the other has density 1/2, which is one way to make precise the intuition that the former is bigger &lt;em&gt;as a subset of the natural numbers&lt;/em&gt; (though not &lt;em&gt;as a set&lt;/em&gt;) than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastActivityDate="2010-07-21T23:32:07.050" CommentCount="1" />

The relations are normally written as diagrams, but without latex implement, I wont type them here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of a monoidal action, consider a group action, and formulate it a little more categorically, by writing the two axioms as diagrams.

Note here that the trivial monoidal category will be the monoidal category with one object one morphism and all the other monoidal data is trivially determined.

Take the second example above- can we be sure that algebraic operations can 'parse' those infinitely many sentences and make the simple sentence on the right?? (this is to do with a property called &lt;strong&gt;compactness&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal can be split into two distict subgoals:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundness:&lt;/strong&gt; $A \vdash B \Rightarrow A \models B$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completeness:&lt;/strong&gt; $A \models B \Rightarrow A \vdash B$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the first stops you proving things that aren't true when we interpret them and the second means that everything we know to be true on interpretation, we must be able to prove.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sentential calculus, for example, can be proved complete (and was in Godel's lesser known, but celebrated completeness theorem), but other for other systems Godel's incompleteness theorem, give us a terrible choice between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary:&lt;/strong&gt; The interplay of meaning and axiomatic machine mathematics, captured by the difference between $\models$ and $\vdash$, is a subtle and interesting thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="160" LastEditorUserId="160" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-02-26T11:25:41.947" LastActivityDate="2012-02-26T11:25:41.947" CommentCount="2" />

He first introduced it as a way for machines to solve geometric problems relating the proportions between areas, lengths or angles. Then some Olympiad people I know start using it to bash that kind of problem. I don't know what the name is in English, but a literal translation of the method is &quot;point removal method&quot;. Although it's not exactly same as what you are talking about, because &quot;input a geometry problem&quot; requires you to provide the construction of the problem from a straight edge and a compass, which is almost like &quot;manually converting to equations&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the basic idea:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construct the original problem by compass and straightedge, make a list of every constructed point ordered by the order of construction, let it be L. Record which points are used in the construction of every point.(Only the points used to construct point P are used in the substitution steps 3 and 4)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translate the theorem into a equivalent form. Usually a/b = 1, where a and b are functions of length and area of certain segments or triangles. Let's call this equation E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let P be the last point of L. For every P appears in E, substitute it with another relation using other points from L(P itself is also allowed), usually if we are proving about lengths, we might use area. A list of possible operations are required for this step. It can branches off as a proof tree when the program decide to use different substitutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do another substitution that eliminates the point P. For example, if in the step before, we substitute length to area, then we want to find something involve the length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do 3 to 4 over and over until we have 1=1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Angle bisector theorem&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given: $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ of triangle $\triangle ABC$.

Then construct $AD$. The points in the list $L$ are $A,B,C,D$.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The equivalent equation to the theorem is&#xA;$\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{DC}{BD} = 1$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{DC}{BD} = \frac{AB}{AC} \frac{ACD}{ABD}$ (substitute length with area)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$=\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{\frac{1}{2} AC\cdot AD \sin \angle CAD}{\frac{1}{2} AB\cdot AD \sin \angle BAD}$, this step successfully remove point $D$ by cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$=\frac{AB}{AC} \frac{AC}{AB} =1$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is only a non-formal explanation of how such automated system would work.

In this form, unlike the standard axiom system, infinite sets are not allowed.  There are important mathematicians, such as Kronecker, who supported such a system.  I can see that the natural numbers and rational numbers can easily defined in a finitist system, by easy adaptations of the standard definitions.   But in order to do any significant mathematics, we need to have definitions for the irrational numbers that one is likely to encounter in practice, such as  e  or sqrt(2).  In standard constructions, real numbers are defined as Dedekind cuts, or Cauchy sequences, which are actually sets of infinite cardinality, so they are of no use here. My question is, how would a real number like those be defined in a finitist axiom system.

Using these rules you can carry out a vast amount of mathematics relating to natural numbers. For example you can prove lots of theorems in number theory using these axioms. The Peano axioms make no reference to sets at all, whether finite or infinite. The only things that exist in this theory are naturals. You can't even form the set of all integers. You can only talk about the naturals themselves. So a vast amount of mathematics would work absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though Peano's axioms are about naturals, you can already use them to talk about finite sets. The idea is that any finite set could be encoded as a finite sequence of symbols which in turn could be represented as naturals using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Godel numbering&lt;/a&gt;. So questions like &quot;is this set a subset of that one?&quot; could be turned into purely arithmetical statements about Godel numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'm pretty sure that declaring that there is no infinite set would make little difference to people working within the system defined by Peano's axioms. We'd still have all of the natural numbers to work with, we just wouldn't be able to assemble them into a single entity, the set of all natural numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are theorems that make essential use of an infinite set. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Goodstein's theorem&lt;/a&gt;. Without infinite sets (or a substitute of some sort) it would be impossible to prove this result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the overall result would be, I think, that you could still do lots of mathematics fine. The mathematics you could do wouldn't be all that weird. And you'd simply be depriving yourself of a useful proof technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, you'd still be able to say many things about real numbers. A real number can be thought of as a Cauchy sequence. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cauchy sequence&lt;/a&gt; is a certain type of sequence of rational numbers. So many statements about real numbers, when unpacked, are really statements about rational, and hence naturals, but in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update: Uncovering precisely what parts of mathematics you need in order to prove things is a field known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reverse mathematics&lt;/a&gt;.

Since $x_n$ is rational, $f(x_n) = g(x_n)$ for all $n$, so the two limits must be equal and so $f(c) = g(c)$ for all real $c$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="72" LastEditorUserId="354" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2011-07-27T17:15:57.620" LastActivityDate="2011-07-27T17:15:57.620" CommentCount="2" />

So 10 would correspond to the set with ten things -- like a bag of ten stones. Pretty straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is that when we consider ten a subset of the real numbers, we actually redefine it. This is not emphasized even in higher mathematics classes, like real analysis; it just happens when we define the real numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is 10 when constructed in the real numbers? Well, at least with the Dedekind cut version of the real numbers, &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; real numbers correspond to a set with an infinite amount of elements. This makes 10 under the hood look drastically different, although in practice it operates exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let's return to the question: Why is 10 the same as 9.99999? Because the real numbers have this completely surprising quality, where there is no next real number. So when you have two real numbers that are as close together as possible, they are the same. I can't think of any physical object that has this quality, but it's how the real numbers work (makes &quot;real&quot; seem ironic).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With integers (bag of stones version) this is not the same. When you have two integers as close to each other as possible they are still different, and they are distance one apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, 10 bag of stones are not the same as 9.9999999 but 10 the natural number, where natural numbers are a subset of the real numbers is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the real numbers have these tricky edge cases that are hard to understand intuitively.

First we only look at the absolute values. Let us try to calculate the probability of this never exceeding x. The probability of 2x+1 consecutive moves all being the same is some p&gt;0. If this ever occurs, then the absolute value will exceed x. Consider n groups of 2x+1 moves, the probability that at least one of these is all the same is 1-(1-p)^n, which approaches 1. So the probability of reaching each absolute value x (other than 0) is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, lets consider the probability of reaching 0 again. Without loss of generality, suppose our first move is +1. We have a 100% chance of reaching a point a distance of 1 from this. There is a 50% that the first such point is 0 and 50% that it is 2. From 2, we have a 100% chance of reaching a point two away from this. 50% chance that this is 0, 50% that this is 4. Repeating, it is easy to see that we have to reach 0 again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, after we have reached an absolute value x, the probability of reaching it again is 1. So we reach each absolute value an infinite number of times. Due to symmetry, we can expect to reach each x an infinite number of times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;: I originally tried to apply it to the 2d case as you can see below.

Consider the simple random walk which makes steps to the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest with equal probability. The projections of this walk onto the x- and y-axes are independent simple random walks in one dimension. Rotating and rescaling gives the &quot;usual&quot; SRW in two dimensions (with steps north, east, south and west) and doesn't change the probability of being at $0$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So $\rho_2(2n) = \left(\binom{2n}{n}/2^{2n}\right)^2$.  This is asymptotic to $1/(\pi n)$, and the expected number of returns to the origin is the $\sum_{n \geq 1} \rho_2(2n)$, so the expected number of returns to the origin is infinite.

And in general it happens that d^2 = 0, that is boundaries always have no boundaries themselves.  Now suppose we remove the origin from the plane and take a circle around the origin.  This circle is in the kernel of d since it has no boundary.  However, it does not bound any 2-chain in the space (since the origin is removed) and so it is not in the image of the boundary operator on two-dimensions.  Thus the circle represents a non-trivial element in the quotient space ker d / im d.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I have defined things makes the above a homology theory simply because the d operator decreases dimension.  Cohomology is the same thing only the operator increases dimension (for example the exterior derivative on differential forms).  Thus algebraically there really is no difference between cohomology and homology since we can just change the grading from i to -i.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a homology we can get a corresponding cohomology theory by dualizing, that is by looking at maps from the group of chains to the underlying group (e.g. Z or R).  Then d on the cohomology theory becomes the adjoint of the previous boundary operator and thus increases degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9" LastEditorUserId="9" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-07-23T15:05:02.630" LastActivityDate="2010-07-23T15:05:02.630" />

I know I can't just divide $\$ $546.97/10=$\$ $54.697, because the lender is still charging interest while the borrower pays off this remaining debt, so there would still be the interest left over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation isn't mentioned anywhere in my calculator manual!

Since the payments are 1.5x the 10% interest, it's just like paying off 5% of the principal each year! This saves me a lot of time, because I can just set &lt;code&gt;I/Y=-5&lt;/code&gt; and get &lt;code&gt;FV=598.74&lt;/code&gt; on my calculator. I did it the long way by calculating the future value of each interest payment (turns out they were not all $75, because the outstanding principal got smaller), and they were the same. Is this always going to work, or did I just get lucky here?  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another update!&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I think I solved it.

Lie algebras and Lie groups definitely come up here, but I'm not familiar enough to explain anything.

The nonabelian version of L-functions (Artin L-functions) rely on the representations of the Galois group (in the abelian case, these just correspond to sums of 1-dimensional characters).  For instance, the proof that Artin L-functions are meromorphic in the whole plane relies on (I think) &lt;del&gt;Artin&lt;/del&gt; Brauer's theorem (i.e., a corollary of the usual statement) that any irreducible character is an &lt;del&gt;rational&lt;/del&gt; integer combination of induced characters from cyclic subgroups -- this is in Serre's &lt;em&gt;Linear Representations of Finite Groups.&lt;/em&gt; Also, the Langlands program studies  representations of groups $GL_n(\mathbb{A}_K)$ for $\mathbb{A}_K$ the adele ring of a global field.

What is the dimension of the irreducible representation associated to a Young diagram?

As implied in the question, I knew that congruence and similarity transformations are constructible.  Immediately below this section is my original answer, which only demonstrates congruence transformations and was intended more to give an idea of what an answer might look like (since, at the time, there was another answer that was not particularly helpful).  In the last section of this answer is my justification that all affine transformations of the plane are constructible.  In re-reading that now, I realize that I'd assumed the ability to construct a point, say $P&amp;#39;$, on a line, say $\overleftrightarrow{RP}$, such that $\frac{RP&amp;#39;}{RP}$ is equal to some known ratio.  This is equivalent to being able to construct the dilation of $P$ by the known ratio about center $R$.

The only one of these that I have not yet shown is constructible is inversion, so I have appended that construction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a partial answer, here are constructions of the basic congruence transformations, assuming basic construction techniques like constructing a line parallel or perpendicular to a given line through a given point and angle-copying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reflection&lt;/strong&gt;  Given a point $P$ and a line $\ell$, construct the line perpendicular to $\ell$ through $P$, and construct the circle centered at the intersection of this new line and $\ell$ and passing through $P$.

Since affine transformations preserve collinearity, $X$ must be on $\overleftrightarrow{MN}$ and on $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$, which is a contradiction, so $\overleftrightarrow{M&amp;#39;N&amp;#39;}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{P&amp;#39;Q&amp;#39;}$ cannot intersect.  Thus, affine transformations preserve parallelism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An affine transformation is determined by a $\triangle ABC$ and its image, $\triangle A&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;$ (per &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AffineTransformation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MathWorld&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation#Affine_transformation_of_the_plane&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; talks about defining an affine transformation by a parallelogram and its image, which is equivalent since affine transformations preserve parallelism).  Given point $P$ and triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;$, construct line $\ell_1$ through $P$ parallel to $\overline{AB}$ and line $\ell_2$ through $P$ and parallel to $\overline{AC}$, call the intersection of $\ell_1$ with $\overline{AC}$ $I_1$ and call the intersection of $\ell_2$ with $\overline{AB}$ $I_2$, extend $\overline{A&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;}$ past $B&amp;#39;$ to a point $I&amp;#39;_2$ such that $\frac{AB}{AI_2}=\frac{A&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;}{A&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;_2}$, extend $\overline{A&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;}$ past $C&amp;#39;$ to a point $I&amp;#39;_1$ such that $\frac{AC}{AI_1}=\frac{A&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;}{A&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;_1}$, construct line $\ell&amp;#39;_1$ through $I&amp;#39;_1$ parallel to $\overline{A&amp;#39;B&amp;#39;}$ and line $\ell&amp;#39;_2$ through $I&amp;#39;_2$ parallel to $\overline{A&amp;#39;C&amp;#39;}$.

He needs to identify the poisoned wine as soon as possible, and with the least resources, so he hires the protagonist, a Mathematician.

However, it is slow-acting.  The nature of the slow-acting poison means that there is only time to test one &quot;drink&quot; per servant. (A drink may be a mixture of any number of wines)  (Assume that the King needs to know within an hour, and that any poison in the drink takes an hour to show any symptoms)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the minimum amount of servants you would need to identify the poisoned wine?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With enough time and reasoning, one can eventually see that this requires at most &lt;strong&gt;ten&lt;/strong&gt; ($10$) servants (in fact, you could test 24 more wines on top of that 1000 before requiring an eleventh servant).

So it seems like it is accurate to say that if mathematics is consistent, we have a polynomial with no integer roots, but we can't prove it. However, if we are assuming maths is consistent, we can use this to prove that the equation is unsolvable (indeed that is what we have done).

The problem is, this isn't a homomorphism in the category of vector spaces; it is rather a bilinear map. So you can think of it as a map $V \otimes V^* \to k$ instead.  This is why you need a tensor structure to think of duals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't enough, though, because we need to know that the pairing is nondegenerate.  One way to express this is that there's a map $k \to V \times V^*$ mapping 1 to the &quot;Casimir element&quot; (which is the sum $\sum e_i \otimes e_i^{\vee}$ where $e_i$ ranges over a basis of $V$ and $e_i^{\vee}$ the dual basis; it is independent of the choice of $e_i$ as a quick computation shows).  The Casimir morphism satisfies the condition that $V \to (k) \otimes V \to (V \otimes V^*) \otimes V \to V \otimes (V^* \otimes V)$ is just the identity.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Conversely, this is enough to show that the pairing is nondegenerate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, how does this make sense in a symmetric tensor category?  Basically, $V$ is the object, $V^*$ the putative dual, and $k$ replaced by the unital object. This definition is entirely arrow-theoretic, and it all goes through as usual.&#xA;It is an exercise to check that the dual is unique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coincides with the usual dual in the category of vector spaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coincides with the dual sheaf if one is working in the category of locally free sheaves on a scheme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This corresponds to the dual (contragredient) representation in the (tensor) category of representations of any Hopf algebra (so this includes representations of finite groups and Lie algebras)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and what happens if you don't have a symmetric tensor category?

They’re a hard thing to teach well, too, for two main reasons that I can see: the formulas you learn for computing them are messy and complicated, and there’s no “natural” way to interpret the value of the determinant, the way it’s easy to interpret the derivatives you do in calculus at first as the slope of the tangent line. It’s hard to believe things like the invertibility condition you’ve stated when it’s not even clear what the numbers mean and where they come from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than show that the many usual definitions are all the same by comparing them to each other, I’m going to state some general properties of the determinant that I claim are enough to specify uniquely what number you should get when you put in a given matrix. Then it’s not too bad to check that all of the definitions for determinant that you’ve seen satisfy those properties I’ll state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to think about if you want an “abstract” definition of the determinant to unify all those others is that it’s not an array of numbers with bars on the side. What we’re really looking for is a function that takes N vectors (the N columns of the matrix) and returns a number. Let’s assume we’re working with real numbers for now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember how those operations you mentioned change the value of the determinant? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Switching two rows or columns changes the sign. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) Multiplying one row by a constant multiplies the whole determinant by that constant. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) The general fact that number two draws from: the determinant is &lt;em&gt;linear in each row&lt;/em&gt;. That is, if you think of it as a function $\det: \mathbb{R}^{n^2} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then $ \det(a \vec{v_1} +b \vec{w_1}, \vec{v_2},...,\vec{v_n}) = a \det(\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},...,\vec{v_n}) + b \det(\vec{w_1}, \vec{v_2}, ...,\vec{v_n})$, and the corresponding condition in each other slot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I claim that these facts, together with the fact that the determinant of the identity matrix is one, is enough to define a &lt;em&gt;unique function&lt;/em&gt; that takes in N vectors (each of length N) and returns a real number, the determinant of the matrix given by those vectors. I won’t prove that, but I’ll show you how it helps with some other interpretations of the determinant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, there’s a nice geometric way to think of a determinant. Consider the unit cube in N dimensional space: the set of vectors of length N with coordinates 0 or 1 in each spot. The determinant of the linear transformation (matrix) T is the &lt;em&gt;signed volume of the region gotten by applying T to the unit cube&lt;/em&gt;. (Don’t worry too much if you don’t know what the “signed” part means, for now).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does that follow from our abstract definition?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, if you apply the identity to the unit cube, you get back the unit cube. And the volume of the unit cube is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stretch the cube by a constant factor in one direction only, the new volume is that constant. And if you stack two blocks together aligned on the same direction, their combined volume is the sum of their volumes: this all shows that the signed volume we have is linear in each coordinate when considered as a function of the input vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, when you switch two of the vectors that define the unit cube, you flip the orientation. (Again, this is something to come back to later if you don’t know what that means).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there are ways to think about the determinant that aren’t symbol-pushing. If you’ve studied multivariable calculus, you could think about, with this geometric definition of determinant, why determinants (the Jacobian) pop up when we change coordinates doing integration. Hint: a derivative is a linear approximations of the associated function, and consider a “differential volume element” in your starting coordinate system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s not too much work to check that the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $\det((a,b),(c,d))$, either: you might try that to get a sense for things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="76" LastEditorUserId="900" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-11-14T18:37:07.847" LastActivityDate="2010-11-14T18:37:07.847" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-07-25T06:05:47.733" CommentCount="7" />

The global minimum of this surface lies at the origin (at $x=0$, $y=0$).  If we are given the constraint, a requirement on the relationship between $x$ and $y$, that $3x+y=6$, then the origin can no longer be our solution (since $3\cdot 0 + y \cdot 0 \neq 6$).  Yet, there is a lowest point on this function satisfying the given constraint. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we have so far:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Objective function: $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;subject to: $3x+y=6$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From here we can derive the Lagrange formulation of our constrained minimization problem.  This will be a function $L$ of $x$, $y$, and a single Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ (since we have only a single constraint). &lt;em&gt;It will be this new function that we minimize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$L(x,y,\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + \lambda(3x+y-6)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Lagrange formulation incorporates our original function along with our constraint(s).  On the way toward minimizing $L$, we will have to minimize the objective function $x^2 + y^2$, as well as minimize the contribution from the constraint, which is now weighted by a factor of $\lambda$.  If the constraint is met, then the expression $3x+y-6$ will necessarily be zero, and will not contribute anything the value of $L$. This is the &lt;em&gt;trick&lt;/em&gt; of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimizing the Lagrange formulation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To minimize $L$ we simply find the $x,y$, and $\lambda$ values that make its gradient zero.  (This is exactly analogous to setting the first derivative to zero in calculus.)  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\nabla L = 0:$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 2x + 3 \lambda = 0$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 2y + \lambda = 0$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 3x + y - 6 = 0$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our example we have arrived at a system of simultaneous linear equations which can (and should) be solved with matrix algebra.  The solution will be a vector holding values for $x, y$ and $\lambda$.

It seems obvious to us now, but it must have seemed strange at first. How can the number of sheep I have be zero, when I don't actually have any sheep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Negative numbers are the next most obvious addition to the family of numbers. But what does it mean to have -2 apples? If I have 3 apples and you have 5, it's convenient to be able to say that I have -2 more apples than you. Even so, during the middle ages many mathematicians were very uncomfortable with the idea of negative numbers and tried to arrange their equations so that they didn't occur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rationals (fractions) seem real enough, since I'm happy to have 2/5 of a pizza. However, this is not the number of pizzas that I have, just a ratio between 0 and 1 pizzas, and so is further removed from the concept of counting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More significant philosophical problems problems arose when irrational numbers were first discovered by the classical Greeks. They were astonished when Euclid (or one of his predecessors) proved that the diagonal of a unit square could not be represented by ratio of two integers. This was such an outrageous idea to them that they called these numbers &quot;irrational&quot;. However, they couldn't easily deny their existence since they have a direct geometric representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Irrational numbers were first understood as the solutions to algebraic equations such as x^2 = 2 but this still doesn't cover all the possible numbers that we need. For example, the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference is π and so has a direct geometric representation. However, in 1882 π was proved to be transcendental, meaning that it can't be defined as the solution to a specific algebraic equation. This begins to seem a lot less &quot;real&quot;, especially when you consider that there are many important transcendental numbers that, unlike π, don't have a geometric interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are of course many algebraic equations that don't have a solution even among the irrational numbers, and in some ways there's no reason why they should. However, when 16th century mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano began working on solutions to cubic equations they found that the square roots of negative numbers began cropping up very naturally in their procedures, even though the solutions themselves were purely real. This eventually led people to explore the arithmetic of complex numbers and they were surprised to find that it produced a consistent and beautiful theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, complex numbers don't have such an intuitively obvious geometrical meaning as the numbers that came before. They are typically represented graphically as points in the 2D plane, and the rules of addition and multiplication are equivalent to certain operations on lengths and angles, but those operations aren't driven by geometrical necessity in quite the way that squares and circles are. Even so, complex numbers are a perfect representation for various physical phenomena such as the state of particles in quantum mechanics and the behaviour of varying currents in electrical circuits. They are also very useful for reducing the cost of computation in 3D computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The really special thing about complex numbers, though, is that they are the end of this journey that has been going on for millenia. There is no need to invent further number systems to provide solutions to problems expressed in terms of complex numbers because now every non-contradictory equation, algebraic or transcendental, has a solution within the complex numbers. They are a self-sufficient, consistent system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Physicists have been breaking matter down into smaller and smaller particles over the years. Molecules, atoms, nuclei, protons, quarks. When will the process stop? For several decades it was felt that quarks could be the final, indivisible particle. However, new theoretical frameworks such as string theory are suggesting that there may be more fundamental entities than quarks. Because physics ultimately relies on experimental verification, we can never be sure that there aren't going to be more steps in the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In mathematics, however, we can prove things for all time. Complex numbers are the final step in the sequence, the numbers that we have been reaching for since before the beginning of recorded history. Every other number system is just a subset of the complex numbers, just a part of the true picture.

This would make the side length 2d, the perimeter 8d and the area 4d^2.  Now, the derivative of the area is the perimeter.

So you do need to find an arc length but it is easy to do this without invoking calculus if you know about the dot product.  Suppose the two points on the circle are represented by the vectors v and w.  If v*w denotes the dot product of these two vectors, then the angle between them will be arccos(v*w/R^2) (we divide by R^2 since v and w have length R).  Assuming this is in radians, to get the length of the arc connecting them we just multiply this angle by R to get R*arcos(v*w/R^2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are quite lucky that there is such a simple formula.  For most manifolds, the curves that minimize distances are not very easy to find since it involves solving a non-linear differential equation (the geodesic equation).

So:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if sin &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt; = 1, then C is a right angle, the triangle is uniquely determined, so congruence can be established;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if A &amp;ge; 90&amp;deg;, C &amp;lt; 90&amp;deg;, so there is only one solution for C that makes sense in this triangle, the triangle is uniquely determined, and congruence can be established (one might call this SSobtuseA);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;if A &amp;lt; 90&amp;deg;, but BC &amp;ge; AB, then B &amp;ge; C (in a triangle, the largest/smallest side is opposite the largest/smallest angle), so the only solution for C that makes sense in this triangle is the one with C&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;90&amp;deg; (if B&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;C&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;90&amp;deg;, then A + B + C &gt; 180&amp;deg;), the triangle is uniquely determined, and congruence can be established (one might call this SsA, with the relative sizes of the S/s indicating the relative lengths);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;otherwise (when A &amp;lt; 90&amp;deg; and BC &amp;lt; AB), there are two possible values for C, both of which lead to triangles, so there are two possible triangles satisfying the given information, and congruence cannot be established.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to your specific question, if the angle were 91&amp;deg; (case 2), congruence would follow; if the angle were 89&amp;deg;, congruence may or may not follow, depending on what you can determine about the other sides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, RHS is also commonly referred to (at least in the midwestern U.S. in contemporary high school geometry) as hypotenuse-leg or HL.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="72" LastEditorUserId="72" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-08-05T19:59:38.613" LastActivityDate="2010-08-05T19:59:38.613" CommentCount="3" />

What properties might you want such a distribution to have?  Well, if you're doing number theory then you want to think of the prime numbers as acting &quot;independently&quot;: knowing that a number is divisible by $p$ should give you no information about whether it's divisible by $q$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That quickly leads you to the following realization: you should choose the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization independently.  So how should you choose these?  It turns out that the probability distribution on the non-negative integers with maximum entropy and a given mean is a geometric distribution, as explained for example by Keith Conrad &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/analysis/entropypost.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  So let's take the probability that the exponent of $p$ is $k$ to be equal to $(1 - r_p) r_p^k$ for some constant $r_p$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gives the probability that a positive integer $n = p_1^{e_1} ... p_k^{e_k}$ occurs as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\displaystyle C \prod_{i=1}^{k} r_p^{e_i}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $C = \prod_p (1 - r_p)$.  So we need to choose $r_p$ such that this product converges.  Now, we'd like the probability that $n$ occurs to be monotonically decreasing as a function of $n$.  It turns out (and this is a nice exercise) that this is true if and only if $r_p = p^{-s}$ for some $s &amp;gt; 1$ (since $C$ has to converge), which gives the probability that $n$ occurs as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\frac{ \frac{1}{n^s} }{ \zeta(s)}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where $\zeta(s)$ is the zeta function.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One way of thinking about this argument is that $\zeta(s)$ is the partition function of a statistical-mechanical system called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primon_gas&quot;&gt;Riemann gas&lt;/a&gt;.  As $s$ gets closer to $1$, the temperature of this system increases until it would require infinite energy to make $s$ equal to $1$.  But this limit is extremely important to understand: it is the limit in which the probability distribution above gets closer and closer to uniform.  So it's not surprising that you can deduce statistical information about the primes by studying the behavior as $s \to 1$ of this distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me mention two other reasons to care about the limit as $s \to 1$ of the above distribution.  First, the basic reason to think of the primes as acting independently is the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  Second, a natural reason to look at a distribution where the probability that a number has exactly $k$ factors of $p$ is $(1 - p^{-1}) p^{-k}$ is that this is precisely the distribution you get on the residues $\bmod p^n$ for $k &amp;lt; n$.  In fact, I believe this can be upgraded to the corresponding statement about Haar measure on the $p$-adic integers.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="232" LastEditorUserId="6622" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-01-02T14:46:37.430" LastActivityDate="2012-01-02T14:46:37.430" CommentCount="4" />

Where calculus comes in is if you're dealing with an inconstant velocity (a curved line).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that's not making sense right off, just try to realistically graph the movement of a car as it accelerates/decelerates, where the y-axis is position and the x-axis is time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using algebra, you can't take the slope of a curved line.

The Hodge dual depends on a surprising amount of information: you need a vector space $V$ which is equipped with both an inner product and an orientation, which is essentially a choice of which bases of $V$ are &quot;right-handed.&quot;  So let's see what we can say ignoring all this information first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any abstract vector space $V$ of finite dimension $n$ has exterior powers $\Lambda^2 V, \Lambda^3 V, ... \Lambda^n V$, the last of which is one-dimensional.  The vector spaces $\Lambda^k V$ and $\Lambda^{n-k} V$ always have the same dimension, so we would like to be able to define some sort of &quot;canonical&quot; map between them.  What can we say?  Well, they are always dual: the wedge product defines a natural bilinear map $\Lambda^k V \times \Lambda^{n-k} V \to \Lambda^n V$, and since the latter is one-dimensional this means (once you've proven nondegeneracy) that the two vector spaces are in fact dual.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But duality does not give you a map between them.  When two vector spaces $V, W$ are dual, meaning there is a nondegenerate bilinear map $V \times W \to F$ (where $F$ is the ground field), all you get is an isomorphism $V \simeq W^{\ast}$.  Here you get an isomorphism $\Lambda^k V \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$, &lt;strong&gt;once you have specified an isomorphism&lt;/strong&gt; $\Lambda^n V \simeq F$.  This is equivalent to picking out a distinguished vector in $\Lambda^n V$, which there is no way to do in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the answer is to introduce extra data.  To identify $\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$ with $\Lambda^{n-k} V$, we need an inner product.  An inner product gives you &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt; distinguished vectors in $\Lambda^n V$, as follows: take any orthonormal basis $b_1, ... b_n$.  Then wedging together the $b_i$ in any order gets you one of two elements of $\Lambda^n V$, depending on whether the corresponding permutation is even or odd.  But without any extra data, there is no way to identify one of these elements with $1$ and one of these elements with $-1$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extra data that does this is an orientation on $V$, which tells you which bases are &quot;right-handed&quot; and which are &quot;left-handed.&quot;  So an oriented orthonormal basis gives you a distinguished element of $\Lambda^n V$, which gives you a distinguished isomorphism $\Lambda^k V \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast}$, which composed with the isomorphism $\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\ast} \simeq \Lambda^{n-k} V$ is the Hodge dual.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~toni/hodge.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these notes&lt;/a&gt; I just found on Google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="232" LastEditorUserId="232" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-07-28T01:19:14.083" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T01:19:14.083" CommentCount="8" />

The exterior product is the plane element spanned by both $a$ and $b$, and the dual is the vector orthogonal to that plane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite interpretation of the cross product, but it's only helpful, of course, if you're familiar with exterior algebra and the Hodge dual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: The wedge product can be found by formally computing &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$(a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3) \wedge (b_1 e_1 + b_2 e_2 + b_3 e_3)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;using the distributivity and anticommutation relations of the exterior product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="251" LastEditorUserId="251" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-07-28T02:03:15.647" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T02:03:15.647" CommentCount="1" />

Specifically, lets define $(R, \theta)$ to be the map which multiplies every point in the plane by the number $R$, and then rotates it by the angle $\theta$. We may call these maps &quot;dilations with rotations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such maps can be added and composed (multiplied) in the obvious way, and its not hard to work out that the sum and product of two such mappings is another dilation with rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can also identify the real number $x$ with the map $(x,0)$, i.e. the map which multiplies every point in the plane by $x$.  Then we see that these maps have the magical property that $-1$ has a square root! Namely, if $P$ is the mapping $(1,\pi/2)$ (i.e. rotate every point by angle $\pi/2$), then applying $P$ twice is the same as multiplying every number by $-1$, i.e. $P^2=-1$! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As should be obvious by now, these maps are just complex numbers in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, they are &#xA;singularly useful for solving polynomial equations. Indeed, the real number $x'$ is a root of the polynomial equations $a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n =0$ if and only if the mapping $(x',0)$ satisfies the same equation. So viewing polynomial equations over the set of these mappings loses no solutions, while at the same time giving us additional freedom to do operations such as taking the square roots of negative numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="317" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T02:30:18.093" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-04-15T20:45:29.080" CommentCount="3" />

We will&#xA;  exhibit some modem group-theoretic &#xA;  twists in the ancient method of&#xA;  separation of variables that can be &#xA;  used to provide a foundation for much&#xA;  of special function theory. In &#xA;  particular, we will show explicitly&#xA;  that all special functions that arise &#xA;  via separation of variables in the&#xA;  equations of mathematical physics can &#xA;  be studied using group theory.

The basic&#xA;  relations between Lie groups, special &#xA;  functions, and the method of&#xA;  separation of variables have recently&#xA;  been  clarified. One can now construct&#xA;  a group-theoretic machine that, when &#xA;  applied to a given differential&#xA;  equation of mathematical physms,&#xA;  describes  in a rational manner the&#xA;  possible coordinate systems in which&#xA;  the equation  admits solutions via&#xA;  separation of variables and the&#xA;  various expansion  theorems relating&#xA;  the separable (special function)&#xA;  solutions in distinct  coordinate&#xA;  systems.

You say that p can be located on the right or top line and that p2 can be located on the bottom or left line. Do you mean the rectangle can be rotated? If that's the case, the question should say that p can be on the right or bottom line of the rectangle.

First I'll deal with when p2 is on the bottom and p is on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since p2 is on the bottom line we know the y-coordinate is h, according to the diagram. We also know that p is (0,y). Because of the 45 degree angle, we know that the distance between p's y-coordinate and the lower right corner is the same as the distance between the lower right corner and p2's x-coordinate, which in this case is p2's x-coordinate. Therefore, the coordinates of p2 are (h-y, h).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If p2 is on the left and p is on the bottom, it's very similar. Since p2 is on the left, it's x-coordinate is h.

If a given subset has $s$ in it, add it in; otherwise, take it out.  This defines a bijection between the number of subsets with an even number of elements and the number of subsets with an odd number of elements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The analogous formulas for the subsets with a number of elements divisible by $3$ or $4$ are more complicated, and divide into cases depending on the residue of $n \bmod 6$ and $n \bmod 8$, respectively.  The algebraic derivations of these formulas are as follows (with $\omega$ a primitive third root of unity):  observe that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^k {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega)^n = (-\omega^2)^n$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;while&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n} \omega^{2k} {n \choose k} = (1 + \omega^2)^n = (-\omega)^n$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and that $1 + \omega^k + \omega^{2k} = 0$ if $k$ is not divisible by $3$ and equals $3$ otherwise.

The truth is that the real numbers are a sophisticated mathematical construction and that any explanation of what they &quot;are&quot; which pretends otherwise is a convenient fiction.  Mathematicians need these kind of sophisticated constructions because they are what is required for rigorous proofs.  Before people explicitly constructed the real numbers and used them to define and prove things about other concepts, it was never totally clear what was true or what was false, and everybody was very confused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, Cantor proved that the number of points in the plane is the same as the number of  points on a line.  Many people thought that this was impossible before he did it; they had an intuition that you couldn't possibly &quot;fit&quot; the plane into the line.  More generally, people were pretty sure you couldn't fit $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ if $n$ was greater than $m$.  It wasn't until quite a bit later that mathematicians formalized and proved a rigorous mathematical statement which justified this intuition called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariance_of_domain&quot;&gt;invariance of domain&lt;/a&gt;, which says you can't do this in a &lt;em&gt;continuous&lt;/em&gt; way.  One of the many mathematical constructions you need to even state this theorem is the construction of the real numbers.  (Another is a formal definition of what &quot;continuous&quot; means, but one thing at a time.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what are the real numbers?  They are a formal way to fill &quot;holes&quot; in the rational numbers, which is necessary for all sorts of things.  The most basic thing they are necessary for is doing geometry.  You probably know that the square root of 2 is irrational.  What this means is that it is impossible to think about the diagonal of a square as being the same kind of object as the sides of a square while only using rational numbers.  But you can rotate a diagonal, and it looks just like the side of a square, only a bit longer.  So you'd like a number system in which you can sensibly talk about any number you can construct geometrically.  You'd also like to be able to talk about rotation!  You can't do that with just rational numbers, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how do you fill in enough holes to do geometry?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut&quot;&gt;Dedekind&lt;/a&gt; came up with a very clever way to do this.  It starts by observing that a rational number $q$ is completely determined by the set of rational numbers greater than it and the set of rational numbers less than it.  For example, 1/2 is completely determined by the fact that it's always between 1/2 + 1/n and 1/2 - 1/n.  (For the initiated, this is a special case of the Yoneda lemma.)  But there are &quot;numbers,&quot; such as the square root of 2, which aren't rational, and yet have the property that we can always tell what rational numbers are greater than it and what rational numbers are less than it.  For the square root of 2, these are precisely the fractions p/q such that 2q^2 &amp;lt; p^2 and such that 2q^2 &gt; p^2, respectively.  Dedekind's brilliant idea was the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Define&lt;/em&gt; a real number to be a partition of the rational numbers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Dedekind's construction, the square root of 2 quite literally &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the set of rational numbers that are greater than it, and the set of rational numbers that are less than it. You can define all the usual arithmetic operations on these &quot;numbers,&quot; called Dedekind cuts, and prove all the wonderful theorems you'll find in a standard book on real analysis.  In particular, the property that guarantees that all the holes are filled is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Completeness&quot;&gt;completeness&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Figured I might as well add something about the complex numbers.  The story here is beautiful, and if you're really interested you should check out Tristan Needham's &lt;a href=&quot;http://usf.usfca.edu/vca//&quot;&gt;Visual Complex Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.  Some people say that the point of the complex numbers is to let you solve polynomials, but this is really selling them short.  The complex numbers are an inherently &lt;em&gt;geometric&lt;/em&gt; construction, and should be understood as such.  Their geometry and topology just happens to be responsible for the fact that you can solve polynomials with them, but it's also responsible for much more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick sketch.  Now that you've got the real numbers on your hands, you can rigorously talk about plane geometry.  In plane geometry, an important notion is that of &lt;em&gt;similarity&lt;/em&gt;.  Informally, two figures are similar if they have the same shape.  More formally, two figures are similar if you can rotate, translate, and scale one figure so that it matches up with the other.  So similarity is all about a certain collection of transformations of the points in the plane.  It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program&quot;&gt;Klein&lt;/a&gt; who first realized that the important features of different flavors of &quot;geometry&quot; are captured in what kind of transformations are allowed.  So to do geometry the modern way we should focus our attention on these transformations, which form a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make this easier, let's ignore the translations for now.  We'll pick an origin for our plane, and we'll only allow rotations and scalings about this origin.  Rotations and scalings have the property that they are both linear transformations; this means that if you know what the transformation does to two points $u, v$, you also know what it does to the vector sum $u + v$.  In particular, a linear transformation is determined by what it does to the point $(1, 0)$ and to the point $(0, 1)$.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, rotations and scalings satisfy an extra property: they are, in fact, determined by what they do to the point $(1, 0)$.  This is because $(0, 1)$ can be obtained from $(1, 0)$ by a rotation by 90 degrees, and rotations and scalings &lt;em&gt;commute&lt;/em&gt; with each other: if you rotate x degrees then y degrees, that's the same as rotating y degrees then x degrees, which is the same as rotating x+y degrees.  Similarly, if you rotate x degrees then scale by 2, that's the same as scaling by 2, then rotating x degrees.  So if you know what a rotation-and-scaling does to $(1, 0)$, you just rotate that vector by 90 degrees, and you know what it did to $(0, 1)$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to every rotation-and-scaling, we can assign two real numbers: the coordinates of the image of the point $(1, 0)$.  In general, a rotation by $\theta$ angles followed by a scaling by $r$ sends $(1, 0)$ to $(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$.  A different transformation, say a rotation by $\phi$ angles followed by a scaling by $s$, sends $(1, 0)$ to $(s \cos \phi, s \sin \phi)$.  And their &lt;em&gt;composition&lt;/em&gt; sends $(1, 0)$ to $(rs \cos (\theta + \phi), rs \sin (\theta + \phi))$.  In other words, composition of rotations-and-scalings defines a multiplication law on pairs of real numbers.  What is this law, exactly?  Well, by the angle addition formulas, it's&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$$(a, b) * (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc).$$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is precisely the rule for multiplication in the complex numbers, where $(a, b)$ corresponds to $a + bi$.  You get the rule for addition by observing that not only can you compose two rotations-and-scalings, you can also add their results. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together, the real numbers and the complex numbers provide a foundation for much of modern mathematics and physics.  For example, the complex numbers turn out (for reasons which are still not well understood) to be fundamental in the description of quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="232" LastEditorUserId="232" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-07-28T06:35:01.467" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T06:35:01.467" CommentCount="1" />

As others have said, the question is equivalent to showing: for any prime $p &amp;gt; 3$, $p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $p^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$.  Both of these statements are straightforward to show by just looking at the $\varphi(3) = 2$ reduced residue classes modulo $3$ and the $\varphi(8) = 4$ reduced residue classes modulo $8$.  But what is their significance?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a positive integer $n$, let $U(n) = (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\times}$ be the multiplicative group of units (&quot;reduced residues&quot;) modulo $n$.  Like any abelian group $G$, we have a squaring map&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$[2]: G \rightarrow G$, $g \mapsto g^2$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the image of which is the set of squares in $G$.  So, the question is equivalent to: for $n = 3$ and also $n = 8$, the subgroup of squares in $U(n)$ is the trivial group.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The group $U(3) = \{ \pm 1\}$ has order $2$; since $(-1)^2 = 1$, the fact that the subgroup of squares is equal to $1$ is pretty clear.  But more generally, for any odd prime $p$, the squaring map $[2]$ on $U(p)$ is two-to-one onto its image -- an element of a field has no more than two square roots -- so that precisely half of the elements of $U(p)$ are squares.  It turns out that when $p = 3$, half of $p-1$ is $1$, but of course this is somewhat unusual: it doesn't happen for any other odd prime $p$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The group $U(8) = \{1,3,5,7\}$ has order $4$.  By analogy to the case of $U(p)$, one might expect the squaring map to be two-to-one onto its image so that exactly half of the elements are squares.  But that is not what is happening here: indeed &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$1^2 \equiv 3^2 \equiv 5^2 \equiv 7^2 \equiv 1 \pmod 8$,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so the subgroup of squares is again trivial.  What's different?  Since $\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field, it is legal for a given element to have more than two square roots, but a more insightful answer comes from the structure of the groups $U(n)$.  For any odd prime $p$, the group $U(p)$ is &lt;em&gt;cyclic&lt;/em&gt; of order $p-1$ (&quot;existence of primitive roots&quot;).  It is easy to see that in any cyclic group of even order, exactly half of the elements are squares.  So $U(8)$ must not be cyclic, so it must be the other abelian group of order $4$, i.e., isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group $C_2 \times C_2$.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More generally, if $p$ is an odd prime number and $a$ is a positive integer, then &#xA;$U(p^a)$ is cyclic of order $p^{a-1}(p-1)$ hence isomorphic to $C_{p^{a-1}} \times C_{p-1}$, whereas for any $a \geq 2$, the group $U(2^a)$ is isomorphic to $C_{2^{a-2}} \times C_2$.

The quantum hall effect is the phenomena that the resistance in a 2-dimensional substrate exposed to a perpendicular electric field at close to zero temperature is quantized.  In condensed matter physics there is a notion called quasimomentum that can be thought of as being related to momentum but is a bit different.  We need something different from the classical definition of momentum because the classical definition depends on translation invariance, and in a crystal there is only discrete translation invariance.  In the quantum hall effect, we have two quasimomenta: $k_x, and k_y$, corresponding to quasimomentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions.  The Hamiltonian is periodic in both of these parameters, leading to a fundamental group of the manifold of Hamiltonians of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, i.e. the fundamental group of the torus $T^2$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more to the topic than this.

I want to add some additional remarks and examples for thinking about more general schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tautological remarks: recall that a point x in a scheme X is called a specialization of y if x lies in the Zariski closure of y (and y is called a generalization of x).  So tautologically, a closed points is one that cannot be specialized any further (just as a generic point cannot be generalized any further).  What does specialization really mean:&#xA;ring theoretically, it means taking the image under a homomorphism; so if p and q are prime&#xA;ideals of a ring A, then q is a specialization of p in Spec A if and only if q contains p, i.e. if A/p surjects onto A/q.  It is perhaps best to think of an example: say A is C[x,y],&#xA;p is the prime ideal gen'd by (x-1) and q is the prime (actually maximal ideal) gen'd by (x-1,y).  Then in A/p, we have &quot;specialized&quot; the value of x to equal 1 (because we have &#xA;declared x-1 = 0) but y is still a free variable.  When we pass to the further quotient A/q, we have specialized both x and y: x is specialized to 1 and y is specialized to 0.   At this point, we can't specialize any more; technically, this is because q is a maximal ideal of A,&#xA;so a closed point of Spec A; intuitively, it is because both x and y have now both been &quot;specialized&quot; to actual numbers, and so we can't specialize any further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But suppose now we set B = Z[x,y], and take p and q to be the same, i.e. gen'd by x-1 and by&#xA;(x-1,y) respectively.  Then q is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; maximal; there is more capacity for specialization.&#xA;How is this?  Well, x and y are now taking values in Z (rather than the field C) and so we can also reduce both x and y modulo some prime, say 5; this gives a prime ideal r = (x-1,y,5) in B containing q.  Now r &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; maximal, and so we are done specializing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you have a scheme that is finite type over Z, the closed points will correspond to &#xA;&quot;actual points&quot;, in Kevin's terminology, but defined over finite fields.  The points of the scheme whose coordinates are integers, say, will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be closed.  One has the choice of thinking them of them as &quot;actual points&quot; which nevertheless can be specialized further by reducing modulo primes, or as subvarieties rather than &quot;actual points&quot;, by identifying them&#xA;with their Zariski closures (for a picture of this, see the drawing of Mumford that Kevin links to).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="221" LastEditorUserId="221" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2010-07-28T19:56:54.470" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T19:56:54.470" CommentCount="0" />

When you talk about matrices, you're allowed to talk about things like the entry in the 3rd row and 4th column, and so forth. In this setting, matrices are useful for representing things like transition probabilities in a Markov chain, where each entry indicates the probability of transitioning from one state to another. You can do lots of interesting numerical things with matrices, and these interesting numerical things are very important because matrices show up a lot in engineering and the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In linear algebra, however, you instead talk about linear transformations, which are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; (I cannot emphasize this enough) a list of numbers, although sometimes it is convenient to use a particular matrix to write down a linear transformation. The difference between a linear transformation and a matrix is not easy to grasp the first time you see it, and most people would be fine with conflating the two points of view. However, when you're given a linear transformation, you're not allowed to ask for things like the entry in its 3rd row and 4th column because questions like these depend on a choice of basis. Instead, you're only allowed to ask for things that don't depend on the basis, such as the rank, the trace, the determinant, or the set of eigenvalues.

Suppose you want to multiply two polynomials of degree n, given by their coefficients (a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and (b&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, b&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). In their product, the coefficient of x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; is c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;sum;a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;k-i&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a convolution, and doing it naively would take O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, suppose we represent the polynomials by their &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt; at 2n points. Then the value of the product polynomial (the one we want) at any point is simply the product of the values of our original two polynomials. Thus we have reduced convolution to pointwise multiplication. The Fourier transform and its inverse correspond to polynomial evaluation and interpolation respectively, for certain well-chosen points (roots of unity). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a way of doing both of these in O(n log n) time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Example 2: Convolution of probability distributions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have two independent (continuous) random variables X and Y, with probability densities f and g respectively. In other words, P(X ≤ x) = ∫&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-∞&lt;/sub&gt; f(t)dt and P(Y ≤ y) = ∫&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-∞&lt;/sub&gt; f(t)dt. We often want the distribution of their sum X+Y, and this is given by a convolution: P(X+Y ≤ z) = ∫f(t)g(z-t)dt. This integration may be hard. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But instead of representing the random variables by their densities, we can also represent them by their &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_%28probability_theory%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;characteristic functions&lt;/a&gt; &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;(t) =  E[e&lt;sup&gt;itX&lt;/sup&gt;] and &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = E[e&lt;sup&gt;itY&lt;/sup&gt;]. Then the characteristic function of X+Y is just:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;X+Y&lt;/sub&gt;(t) = E[e&lt;sup&gt;it(X+Y)&lt;/sup&gt;] = &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;(t)&amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;(t) since they're independent. The characteristic function is the continuous Fourier transform of the density function; it is a change of representation in which convolution becomes pointwise multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To quote again the answer on MO, many transformations we want to study (translation, differentiation, integration, …) are actually convolutions, so the Fourier transform helps in a wide number of instances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="205" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T20:54:58.573" CommunityOwnedDate="2011-04-14T11:45:07.350" />

In a typical class, you will see a lot of pictures like this:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Integral_approximations.svg/420px-Integral_approximations.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt text&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;We find the area under the curve by summing up the area of all these little rectangles.

We are adding the areas of the rectangles, which we have numbered 1 through n, to get the complete area under the curve. The area of each rectangle is given by multiplying the height by the width. The height is given by f(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) because the base of the rectangle is at 0, and the top of the rectangle is where it meets the function f. The Δx represents the width of each rectangle.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When we find the integral, we are taking the limit of this sum as the number of rectangles goes to infinity, and each individual rectangle becomes infinitesimally tiny. You can think of the dx as the equivalent of Δx: it represents the infinitesimally small width of each rectangle that we added up to get the area.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you realize this, we can see why integrals only make sense when written ∫f(x)dx. Because we are adding up the areas of rectangles that have height f(x) and width dx. If you try to interpret the expressions you wrote in this way, you will see that they do not really make sense as integrals: you are not summing up rectangles, so you are not finding an area under a curve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You could, of course, define your own notation in which those expressions behave the way you expect them to, but all mathematical notation is driven based on what people find useful, and what people can agree on and easily understand. Your reuse of the integral sign and dx that people are used to seeing in a particular context will probably result in few people adopting your definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastActivityDate="2010-07-28T23:33:30.033" CommentCount="4" />

Thankfully, it's fairly to prove if you allow the counter to be &lt;code&gt;{1...8}&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;{1...5}&lt;/code&gt;. [This proof is by Ben-Or and Cleve.]. Start by representing the computation as a circuit, and ignore the whole wiping-clean thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Define a register machine as follows: It has 3 registers &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3)&lt;/code&gt;, each of which holds a single bit. At each step, the program performs some computation on the registers of the form &lt;code&gt;R_i &amp;lt;-- R_a + x_b R_c&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;R_i &amp;lt;-- R_a + x_b R_c + R_d&lt;/code&gt; (where &lt;code&gt;x_1...x_n&lt;/code&gt; is the input).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, set &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3) = (1,0,0)&lt;/code&gt;. The machine should end in the state &lt;code&gt;R_3 + f R_1&lt;/code&gt;. We'll simulate the circuit using a register machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We now proceed by induction on the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has depth 0, then we just copy the appropriate bit: &lt;code&gt;R_3 &amp;lt;-- R_3 + x_i R_1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the induction, we have 3 cases, according to whether the final gate is NOT, AND, or OR.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the circuit is &lt;code&gt;NOT(f)&lt;/code&gt;. By induction, we can compute &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, yielding the state &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)&lt;/code&gt;. We can therefore perform the instruction &lt;code&gt;R_3 &amp;lt;-- R_3 + R_1&lt;/code&gt; to get the desired output.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the circuit is &lt;code&gt;AND(f_1,f_2)&lt;/code&gt;, then life is a tad more complicated. By induction, we then execute the following 4 instructions&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R_2 &amp;lt;-- R_2 + f_1 R_1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;code&gt;R_3 &amp;lt;-- R_3 + f_2 R_2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;code&gt;R_2 &amp;lt;-- R_2 + f_1 R_1&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;code&gt;R_3 &amp;lt;-- R_3 + f_2 R_2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Assuming I haven't made any typos, we are left with the state &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3+f_1f_2R_1)&lt;/code&gt;, as desired. OR works similarly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;QED.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to process what just happened. It's a slick proof that you have to read 2 or 3 times before it begins to sink in. What we've shown is that we can simulate a circuit by applying a fixed program that stores only 3 bits of information at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To convert this into Aaronson's version, we encode the three registers into the counter (that's why we needed the extra 3 spaces). The simple program uses the input and the clock to determine how far we've made it through the computation and then applies the appropriate change to the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) But what's the deal with 5?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get from 8 states down to 5, you use a similar argument, but are much more careful about exactly how much information needs to be propagated between stages and how it can be encoded. A formal proof requires lots of advanced group theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit to answer Casebash's questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) Correct. Any computation can be expressed as a circuit composed solely of &quot;NOT&quot;, binary-&quot;AND&quot;, and binary-&quot;OR&quot; gates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) The notation &lt;code&gt;f R_1&lt;/code&gt; means (boolean) multiplication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) The program for computing &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; should take input &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)&lt;/code&gt;. We insist that the first two registers are unchanged since we use those as temporary storage in the induction. For example, when computing &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, we compute the first branch and store the result in &lt;code&gt;R_2&lt;/code&gt; while computing the second branch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4) The single bit of output is the final value of &lt;code&gt;R_3&lt;/code&gt;.
