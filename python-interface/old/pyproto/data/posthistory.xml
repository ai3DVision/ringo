You make the rational numbers into a big square grid with the numerator and denominators as the two coordinates.

You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number. This can be done with the naturals (obviously) and the complete range of integers (including negative numbers) and even the rational numbers (so including fractions). It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integer&#xD;&#xA; 2. Create a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digits&#xD;&#xA; 3. Try and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list. &#xD;&#xA; 4. Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list. The same process can then be done again to show the list still isn't complete.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This shows a difference between two obviously infinite sets and leads to the somewhat scary conclusion that there are (at least) 2 different forms of infinity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Here are a couple:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The most famous is that `∇f` yields the **gradient** of `f`.  That is, at any point `(x,y,z)`, `∇f(x,y,z)` is the vector pointing in the direction where it is **most increasing**.  The magnitude of it is the magnitude of the increase.&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    This is easier to understand with, say, a 2D `f(x,y)`.  If `f(x,y)` represents the height of a point at `(x,y)`, then `∇f(x,y)` represents the steepest incline from that point.  Or rather, if you placed a ball on that point, it would *start rolling in the opposite direction of the gradient vector*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Normally, for multi-dimensional functions, it is easiest to find the derivative along an axis (x, y, z, etc.).  With ∇, you can find the derivative along any arbitrary direction by using ∇f * u, where * is the dot product and u is the unit vector along the direction you are calculating.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- ∇ is also used to calculate divergence (amount that vectors are &quot;spreading out&quot;) and curl (amount that vectors are &quot;curling up&quot;) of a vector field.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Divergence is ∇ * f (dot product), and curl is ∇ x f (cross product)&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    They aren't truly &quot;products&quot; in the sense.  Rather, when you are calculating divergence and curl and you must do `d/dx * (something)`, you are actually doing `d/dx (something)` or `d(something)/dx`." />

I've used all of these on occasion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**A way to solve polynomials**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We came up with equations like `x - 5 = 0, what is x?`, and the naturals solved them (easily). Then we asked, &quot;wait, what about `x + 5 = 0`?&quot; So we invented negative numbers. Then we asked &quot;wait, what about `2x = 1`?&quot; So we invented rational numbers. Then we asked &quot;wait, what about `x^2 = 2`?&quot; so we invented irrational numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, we asked, &quot;wait, what about `x^2 = -1`?&quot; This is the only question that was left, so we decided to invent the &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers to solve it. All the other numbers, at some point, didn't exist and didn't seem &quot;real&quot;, but now they're fine. Now that we have imaginary numbers, we can solve every polynomial, so it makes sense that that's the last place to stop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Pairs of numbers**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This explanation goes the route of redefinition. Tell the listener to forget everything he knows about imaginary numbers. You're defining a new number system, only now there are always pairs of numbers. Why? For fun. Then go through explaining how addition/multiplication work. Try and find a good &quot;realistic&quot; use of pairs of numbers (many exist).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, show that in this system,  `(0,1) * (0,1) = (-1,0)`, in other words, we've defined a new system, under which it makes sense to say that `sqrt(-1) = i`, when `i=(0,1)`. And that's really all there is to imaginary numbers: a definition of a new number system, which makes sense to use in most places. And under that system, there **is** an answer to `sqrt(-1)`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The historical explanation**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Explain the history of the imaginary numbers. Showing that mathematicians *also* fought against them for a long time helps people understand the mathematical process, i.e., that it's all definitions in the end.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm a little rusty, but I think there were certain equations that kept having parts of them which used `sqrt(-1)`, and the mathematicians kept  throwing out the equations since there is no such thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, one mathematician decided to just &quot;roll with it&quot;, and kept working, and found out that all those square roots cancelled each other out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amazingly, the answer that was left was the **correct answer** (he was working on finding roots of polynomials, I think).

One reason groups and rings feel similar is that they are both &quot;algebraic structures&quot; in the sense of universal algebra. So for instance, the operation of quotienting via a normal subgroup (for a group) and a two-sided ideal (for a ring) are basically instances of quotienting via an invariant equivalence relation in universal algebra.

It's the same for the hemisphere cross-section, as you can see by doing the Pythagorean theorem with any vector from the sphere center to a point on the sphere at height y to get the radius of the cross section (which is circular).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the cylinder/cone and hemisphere have the same height, by Cavalieri's Principle the volumes of the two are equal.

They are are also space efficient (three numbers). However, it is more difficult to linear interpolate values. Consider the case where you want to interpolate between 359 and 0 degrees. Linearly interpolating would cause a large rotation, even though the two orientations are almost the same. Writing shortest path interpolation, is easy for one axis, but non-trivial when considering the three Euler angles(for instance the shortest route between (240, 57, 145) and (35, -233, -270) is not immediately clear).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rotation matrices specify a new frame of reference using three normalized and orthogonal vectors (Right, Up, Out, which when multiplied become the new x, y, z). Rotation matrices are useful for operations like strafing (side ways movement), which only requires translating along the Right vector of the camera's rotation matrix. However, there is no clear method of interpolating between them. The are also expensive to normalize which is necessary to prevent scaling from being introduced.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Axis angle, as the name suggests, are a way of specifying a rotation axis and angle to rotate around that axis. You can think of Euler angles, as three axis angle rotations, where the axises are the x, y, z axis respectively. Linearly interpolating the angle in a axis angle is pretty straight forward (if you remember to take the shortest path), however linearly interpolating between different axises is not. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Quaternions are a way of specifying a rotation through a axis and the cosine of half the angle. They main advantage is I can pick any two quaternions and smoothly interpolate between them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rotors are another way to perform rotations. Rotors are basically quaternions, but instead of thinking of them as 4D complex numbers, rotors are thought of as real 3D multivectors. This makes their visualization much more understandable (compared to quaternions), but requires fluency in geometric algebra to grasp their significance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay with that as the background I can discuss a real world example. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Say you are writing a computer game&#xD;&#xA;&gt; where the characters are animated in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3ds Max. You need to export a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; animation of the character to play in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; your game, but cannot faithfully&#xD;&#xA;&gt; represent the interpolation used by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the animation program, and thus have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to sample. The animation is going to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be represented as a list of rotations&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for each joint. How should we store&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the rotations? &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If I am going to sample every frame,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not interpolate, and space is not an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; issue, I would probably store the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; rotations as rotation matrices. If&#xD;&#xA;&gt; space was issue, then Euler angles.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That would also let me do things like&#xD;&#xA;&gt; only store one angle for joints like&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the knee that have only one degree of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; freedom.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If I only sampled every 4 frames, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; need to interpolate it depends on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; whether I am sure the frame-rate will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hold. If I am positive that the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; frame-rate will hold I can use axis&#xD;&#xA;&gt; angle relative rotations to perform&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the interpolation. This is atypical.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In most games the frame rate can drop&#xD;&#xA;&gt; past my sampling interval, which would&#xD;&#xA;&gt; require skipping an element in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; list to maintain the correct playback&#xD;&#xA;&gt; speed. If I am unsure of what two&#xD;&#xA;&gt; orientations I need to interpolate&#xD;&#xA;&gt; between, then I would use quaternions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; or rotors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

It can also be proved by simply playing with trigonometric polynomials (i.e., polynomials in $e^{2\pi i k x}$ for $k$ an integer) and using the fact they are dense in the space of all continuous functions with period 1.  In particular, one shows that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function with period 1, then for any $t$,  $\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \lim \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(t+i \xi)$.

Put next to it a hemisphere of radius R. Now consider the cross section of each at height y above the base. For the cylinder/cone system, the area of the cross-section is pi*(R^2-y^2). It's the same for the hemisphere cross-section, as you can see by doing the Pythagorean theorem with any vector from the sphere center to a point on the sphere at height y to get the radius of the cross section (which is circular).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the cylinder/cone and hemisphere have the same height, by Cavalieri's Principle the volumes of the two are equal. The cylinder volume is Pi*R^3, the cone is a third that, so the hemisphere volume is (2/3)*pi*R^3. Thus the sphere of radius R has volume (4/3)*pi*R^3. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I don't have much knowledge of this view, but I am sure they have theorems that show that contradiction like proofs are valid (given their axioms) within certain conditions.

This definite integral is ln(n), so you should expect 1+1/2+1/3+...+1/n to grow like ln(n).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this argument can be made rigorous, it's still unsatisfying because it depends on the fact that the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is probably harder than the original question.

It is 'high level complete system' versus 'low level core with specialist toolboxes'. Mathematica can do all the numeric math and matrix work that Matlab can do, as fast and as accurately. Matlab is almost strictly a subset of the functionality of Mathematica.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Much of the wider functionality for Matlab is sold as additional toolboxes. e.g. Matlab has toolboxes for curve fitting, statistics, optimization, symbolic math, PDEs, Image acquisition etc but ALL of these areas of functionality are built in to Mathematica already. Aside from the cost and inconvenience of making you buy every function that you need separately, the Matlab design means that the core is inherently low level (since it cannot call on any of the toolbox functionality in case you have not purchased that toolbox), and many of these functions do not fit well together (e.g. no toolbox function can be used with symbolic parameters as they are all written using the numeric-only Matlab core).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Matlab's only comparative strength lies in some of its specialist toolboxes (e.g. control theory where it is dominant) but if you are not in that specialism, those are of no use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some specific differences between the core systems:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab is machine precision numeric only with some support for complex arithmetic - all Mathematica functions support machine precision and arbitrary precision real and complex arithmetic, exact arithmetic and symbolic computation.&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab basic data model is 2D (matrices) with a pointer mechanism to emulate higher dimensions - Mathematica basic data model handles any dimensionality without extra work.&#xD;&#xA; - Many of Mathematica's functions switch automatically between different algorithms (with a manual overide) - in Matlab you must always choose the algorithm.&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab requires you to manually linearize ODEs to a system of first order equations before it can solve them - Mathematica accepts any order ODE.&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab can do integration up to only three dimensions (with triplequad) Mathematica handles n-dimensional integration for any n.&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab's language is procedural only (rather like higher level FORTRAN) - Mathematica allows programming in procedural, functional, object oriented and rule based styles.&#xD;&#xA; - Matlab has text interface and a basic home grown IDE - Mathematica has text interface, document interface, GUI tools, and full Eclipse based IDE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: [helium.com][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.helium.com/items/895074-comparing-matlab-and-mathematica" />

Suppose `n not | x`, for `n` prime. From the uniqueness of prime factorisations, `xn` is the first product of `x`, after `0x`, divisible by `n` (use prime factorisation theorem). If we look at the series `kn` in `mod n`, this cycles and must have cycle length `n`. Therefore, each element `x, 2x,... nx` must be different modulo `n`, including one, `y`, with `xy congruent 1 mod n`. Furthermore, due to the cycle length being `n`, each only one of those elements will be an inverse. So every element has a unique inverse (although 1 and -1 are their own inverses).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem#Proofs" />

In fact, the 4-component vector will be mapped back to the normal 3-vector vector via this formula:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [ x(3D) ]   [ x / w ]&#xD;&#xA;    | y(3D) ] = | y / w |&#xD;&#xA;    [ z(3D) ]   [ z / w ]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is called [homogeneous coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates#Use_in_computer_graphics). ***Allowing this makes the perspective projection expressible with a matrix too,*** which can again combine with all other transformations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, since objects farther away should be smaller on screen, we transform the 3D coordinates into 2D using formula&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    x(2D) = x(3D) / (10 * z(3D))&#xD;&#xA;    y(2D) = y(3D) / (10 * z(3D))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now if we apply the projection matrix&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    [ 1 . .  . ] [ x ]   [  x   ]&#xD;&#xA;    | . 1 .  . | | y | = |  y   |&#xD;&#xA;    | . . 1  . | | z |   |  z   |&#xD;&#xA;    [ . . 10 . ] [ 1 ]   [ 10*z ]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;then the real 3D coordinates would become&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    x(3D) := x/w = x/10z&#xD;&#xA;    y(3D) := y/w = y/10z&#xD;&#xA;    z(3D) := z/w = 0.1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;so we just need to chop the z-coordinate out to project to 2D." />

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\prod (x+\zeta_p^i) = z^p$ for $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$.  So if $p&gt;3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these &quot;generalized integers&quot; $Z[\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this [article][1], Dedekind was the first to define a ring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html" />

The negative sign makes combinatorial proofs difficult, so let's rearrange this as&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;f(n) + f(n-2) = 4f(n-1).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then you want to show that the number of n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is four times the number of (n-1)-tilings. (An &quot;n-tiling&quot; is a tiling of a 3 by 2n rectangle by dominoes.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In bijective terms, then, we want a bijection between the set of n-tilings and (n-2)-tilings and the set of (n-1)-tilings, where the (n-1)-tilings are each tagged with the number 1, 2, 3, or 4.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given an (n-1)-tiling, there are three &quot;obvious&quot; ways to obtain an n-tiling from it, namely by adding one of the three 1-tilings on the right end.  These generate tilings which have a vertical line passing all the way through,  two units from the right end; call these &quot;faulted&quot; tilings, and those which don't have a vertical line in that position &quot;faultless&quot;.  &#xD;&#xA;So it suffices to show that the number of faultless n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is the number of (n-1)-tilings.  It's easy to see that the number of faultless n-tilings is 2g(n-2); a faultless tilings must have a horizontal domino covering the second and third squares from the right in some row, and this assumption forces the placement of some other dominoes.  So we need 2g(n-2) + f(n-2) = f(n-1).  Shifting the indices, we need 2g(n-1) + f(n-1) = f(n), which you have already said is true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The first question you have to ask yourself is *where you're working*:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, addition and multiplication are defined on a *structure*, which in this case  is a *set* (basically a collection of &quot;things&quot;) with two *operators* we call *addition* (marked +) and *multiplication* (marked · or × or * or whatever). If this structure holds some properties, which are sometimes called *axioms*, then it is called a [ring][1]. The properties are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The set is closed under the operator +. That is, if a and b are in G, then a+b is also in G.&#xD;&#xA;2. The set has a member which we mark as 0. It has the properties that for every a in G, a+0 = 0 and 0+a = 0.&#xD;&#xA;3. The operation + is commutative: a+b = b+a.&#xD;&#xA;4. The operation + is associative: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c).&#xD;&#xA;5. Every member has an additive inverse: for every a in G there is some b such that a+b = 0 (we mark b as -a).&#xD;&#xA;6. The set is closed under the operator *. That is, if a and b are in G, then a*b is also in G.&#xD;&#xA;7. The set has a member which we mark as 1. It has the properties that for every a in G, a*1 = a and 1*a = a.&#xD;&#xA;8. The operation * is associative: (a*b) * c = a * (b*c).&#xD;&#xA;9. Multiplication is distributive over addition: a * (b+c) = a*b + a*c and (a+b) * c = a*b + a*c.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While this is a long list, and introduces the operator + which is not even explicitly mentioned in the question, these properties are quite natural. For example, the integers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} we all know and love indeed form a ring. The real numbers also form a ring  (in fact they form a [field][2], which means they hold even more properties).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In regard to your question, the identity x * 1 = x (I assume that's what you meant) is in fact an axiom - it is axiom 7. However, the other two identities are results of the other axioms:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**First identity:** We use axioms 2 and 9 to get&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;0 * x = (0+0) * x = 0*x + 0*x&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and then by adding -(0*x) (the additive inverse of 0*x, from axiom 5) to both sides,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;0 = 0*x&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Second identity:** As stated in axiom 5, -(-x) is just to notation used which means &quot;the additive inverse of -x&quot;. To show that -(-x) = x we need to show that x is in fact the additive inverse of -x, or in other words that x + -x = 0 and -x + x = 0. But that's just what axiom 5 says, so we're done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Last point: You might be wondering why did we have to go and introduce addition to answer a question about multiplication? Well, it so happens that without addition the other two identities are simply not true.

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\prod (x+\zeta_p^iy) = z^p$ for $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$.  So if $p&gt;3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these &quot;generalized integers&quot; $Z[\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this [article][1], Dedekind was the first to define a ring.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html" />

The first derivative of position *should* represent, ideally, the *velocity* of the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a physical context, we would expect the velocity to be the line tangent to the direction of motion at a given time `t`.  Following from this, it would be tangent to the circle at angle `t`.  Also, because the angular velocity is constant, the magnitude of the velocity should be constant as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    r'(t)     = &lt; -sin(t), cos(t) &gt;&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = (-sin(t))^2 + cos(t)^2&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = 1&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|   = 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As expected, the velocity is constant, so the derivatives of sine and cosine are behaving as they should.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can also think about what the **direction** of the velocity would be, as well, compared to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure if this is &quot;cheating&quot; by the bounds of the question, but by visualizing the graph we can see that the velocity, by nature of being tangent to the circle, must be perpendicular to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this is true, then position * velocity = 0 (dot product).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                                  r(t) * r'(t) = 0&#xD;&#xA;      &lt; cos(t), sin(t) &gt; * &lt; -sin(t), cos(t) &gt; = 0&#xD;&#xA;    ( cos(t) * -sin(t) ) + ( sin(t) * cos(t) ) = 0&#xD;&#xA;                  -sin(t)cos(t) + sin(t)cos(t) = 0&#xD;&#xA;                                             0 = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Life is good.  If we assume that the definition of cos(t) is -sin(t) and that the definition of sin(t) is cos(t), we find physical behavior **exactly** like expected: a constant velocity that is always perpendicular to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can take this further and look at the acceleration.  In Physics, we would call this the restoring force.  In a circle, what acceleration would have to exist in order to keep a point moving in a circle?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More specifically, in what direction would this acceleration have to be?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It takes little thought to arrive at the idea that acceleration would have to be center-seeking, and pointing towards the center.

The first derivative of position *should* represent, ideally, the *velocity* of the point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a physical context, we would expect the velocity to be the line tangent to the direction of motion at a given time `t`.  Following from this, it would be tangent to the circle at angle `t`.  Also, because the angular velocity is constant, the magnitude of the velocity should be constant as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    r'(t)     = &lt; -sin(t), cos(t) &gt;&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = (-sin(t))^2 + cos(t)^2&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = sin(t)^2 + cos(t)^2&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|^2 = 1&#xD;&#xA;    |r'(t)|   = 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As expected, the velocity is constant, so the derivatives of sine and cosine are behaving as they should.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can also think about what the **direction** of the velocity would be, as well, compared to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure if this is &quot;cheating&quot; by the bounds of the question, but by visualizing the graph we can see that the velocity, by nature of being tangent to the circle, must be perpendicular to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this is true, then position * velocity = 0 (dot product).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                                  r(t) * r'(t) = 0&#xD;&#xA;      &lt; cos(t), sin(t) &gt; * &lt; -sin(t), cos(t) &gt; = 0&#xD;&#xA;    ( cos(t) * -sin(t) ) + ( sin(t) * cos(t) ) = 0&#xD;&#xA;                  -sin(t)cos(t) + sin(t)cos(t) = 0&#xD;&#xA;                                             0 = 0&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Life is good.  If we assume that the definition of cos(t) is -sin(t) and that the definition of sin(t) is cos(t), we find physical behavior **exactly** like expected: a constant velocity that is always perpendicular to the position vector.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can take this further and look at the acceleration.  In Physics, we would call this the restoring force.  In a circle, what acceleration would have to exist in order to keep a point moving in a circle?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More specifically, in what direction would this acceleration have to be?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It takes little thought to arrive at the idea that acceleration would have to be center-seeking, and pointing towards the center.  So, if we can find that acceleration is **in the opposite direction** as the position vector, the we can be almost certain about the derivatives of sine and cosine.

In other words, there is a point $\xi$ on the circle of radius $R$ such that the function cannot be extended via &quot;analytic continuation&quot; in a neighborhood of $\xi$.  This is a straightforward application of compactness of the circle and can be found in books on complex analysis, e.g. Rudin's. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it does not mean that there is a pole, branch cut, or discontinuity, though those would cause singular values. Indeed, a &quot;pole&quot; on the boundary would only make sense if you can analytically continue the power series to some proper domain containing the disk $D_R(0)$, and this is generally impossible. For instance, the power series $\sum z^{2^j}$ cannot be continued in any way outside the unit disk, because it is unbounded along any ray whose angle is a dyadic fraction.  The unit circle is its natural boundary, though it does not make sense to say that the function has a branch point or pole there.  (More generally, one can show that given any domain in the plane, there is a holomorphic function in that domain which cannot be extended any further, essentially using variations on the same theme.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The function $\sum_j \frac{z^j}{j^2}$, incidentally, is continuous on the closed unit disk, but even though there is a singular point there.

In particular, let $f: R^m \to R^n$ and $q=f(p)$.  Then near $p$, we can write $f$ as $q$ basically something linear plus some &quot;noise&quot; which &quot;doesn't matter&quot; (i.e. is little oh of the distance to $p$).  Call this linear map $L: R^m \to R^n$.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, suppose $g: R^n \to R^s$ is some map and $r = g(q)$.  We can approximate $g$ near $q$ by $r$ plus some linear map $N$ plus some &quot;garbage&quot; which is, again, small.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For simplicity, I'm going to assume that $p,q,r$ are all zero. This is ok, because one can just move one's origin around a bit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, as before, applying $f$ to a point near zero corresponds loosely to applying the linear transformation $L$. Applying $g$ to a point near zero corresponds loosely to applying $N$.  Hence applying $g \circ f$ corresponds up to some ignorable &quot;garbage&quot; to the map $N \circ L$. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This means that $N \circ L$ is the linear approximation to $g \circ f$ at zero, in particular this composition is the derivative of $g \circ f$." />

For example, 3d translation is a non-linear transformation in a 3x3 3d transformation matrix, but is a linear transformation in 3d homogenous co-ordinates using a 4x4 transformation matrix. The same is true of other things like perspective projections. This is why 4x4 matrices are used in 3d graphics as the homogenous co-ordinate system simplifies things a lot." />
