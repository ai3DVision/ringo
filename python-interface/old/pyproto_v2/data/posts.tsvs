"<p>The basic concept is thus:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A 'countable' infinity is one where you can give each item in the set an integer and 'count' them (even though there are an infinite number of them)</li>\n<li>An 'uncountable' infinity defies this. You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number.

It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integer</li>\n<li>Create a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digits</li>\n<li>Try and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list. </li>\n<li>Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list.

"<p>The \u2207 (pronounced ""del"") is an operator, more technically.

Here are a couple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The most famous is that <code>\u2207f</code> yields the <strong>gradient</strong> of <code>f</code>.  That is, at any point <code>(x,y,z)</code>, <code>\u2207f(x,y,z)</code> is the vector pointing in the direction where it is <strong>most increasing</strong>.  The magnitude of it is the magnitude of the increase.</p>\n\n<p>This is easier to understand with, say, a 2D <code>f(x,y)</code>.  If <code>f(x,y)</code> represents the height of a point at <code>(x,y)</code>, then <code>\u2207f(x,y)</code> represents the steepest incline from that point.  Or rather, if you placed a ball on that point, it would <em>start rolling in the opposite direction of the gradient vector</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Normally, for multi-dimensional functions, it is easiest to find the derivative along an axis (x, y, z, etc.).  With \u2207, you can find the derivative along any arbitrary direction by using \u2207f * u, where * is the dot product and u is the unit vector along the direction you are calculating.</p></li>\n<li><p>\u2207 is also used to calculate divergence (amount that vectors are ""spreading out"") and curl (amount that vectors are ""curling up"") of a vector field.</p>\n\n<p>Divergence is \u2207 * f (dot product), and curl is \u2207 x f (cross product)</p>\n\n<p>They aren't truly ""products"" in the sense.

"<p>To understand the benefits of using quaternions you have to consider different ways to represent rotations. </p>\n\n<p>Here are few ways with a summary of the pros and cons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Euler angles</li>\n<li>Rotation matrices</li>\n<li>Axis angle</li>\n<li>Quaternions  </li>\n<li>Rotors (normalized Spinors)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Euler angles are the best choice if you want a user to specify an orientation in a intuitive way. They are are also space efficient (three numbers). However, it is more difficult to linear interpolate values. Consider the case where you want to interpolate between 359 and 0 degrees. Linearly interpolating would cause a large rotation, even though the two orientations are almost the same. Writing shortest path interpolation, is easy for one axis, but non-trivial when considering the three Euler angles(for instance the shortest route between (240, 57, 145) and (35, -233, -270) is not immediately clear).</p>\n\n<p>Rotation matrices specify a new frame of reference using three normalized and orthogonal vectors (Right, Up, Out, which when multiplied become the new x, y, z). Rotation matrices are useful for operations like strafing (side ways movement), which only requires translating along the Right vector of the camera's rotation matrix. However, there is no clear method of interpolating between them. The are also expensive to normalize which is necessary to prevent scaling from being introduced.</p>\n\n<p>Axis angle, as the name suggests, are a way of specifying a rotation axis and angle to rotate around that axis. You can think of Euler angles, as three axis angle rotations, where the axises are the x, y, z axis respectively. Linearly interpolating the angle in a axis angle is pretty straight forward (if you remember to take the shortest path), however linearly interpolating between different axises is not. </p>\n\n<p>Quaternions are a way of specifying a rotation through a axis and the cosine of half the angle. They main advantage is I can pick any two quaternions and smoothly interpolate between them.</p>\n\n<p>Rotors are another way to perform rotations. Rotors are basically quaternions, but instead of thinking of them as 4D complex numbers, rotors are thought of as real 3D multivectors. This makes their visualization much more understandable (compared to quaternions), but requires fluency in geometric algebra to grasp their significance.</p>\n\n<p>Okay with that as the background I can discuss a real world example. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Say you are writing a computer game\n  where the characters are animated in\n  3ds Max. You need to export a\n  animation of the character to play in\n  your game, but cannot faithfully\n  represent the interpolation used by\n  the animation program, and thus have\n  to sample. The animation is going to\n  be represented as a list of rotations\n  for each joint. How should we store\n  the rotations? </p>\n  \n  <p>If I am going to sample every frame,\n  not interpolate, and space is not an\n  issue, I would probably store the\n  rotations as rotation matrices. If\n  space was issue, then Euler angles.\n  That would also let me do things like\n  only store one angle for joints like\n  the knee that have only one degree of\n  freedom.</p>\n  \n  <p>If I only sampled every 4 frames, and\n  need to interpolate it depends on\n  whether I am sure the frame-rate will\n  hold. If I am positive that the\n  frame-rate will hold I can use axis\n  angle relative rotations to perform\n  the interpolation. This is atypical.\n  In most games the frame rate can drop\n  past my sampling interval, which would\n  require skipping an element in the\n  list to maintain the correct playback\n  speed. If I am unsure of what two\n  orientations I need to interpolate\n  between, then I would use quaternions\n  or rotors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-20T23:34:33.507"	""	""	""	"6"	"2"	"99"	""	"2010-07-20T22:08:08.390"	""	"152"	"99"	""	"2010-07-20T23:34:33.507"	""	"71"	""

"<p>There are a few good answers to this question, depending on the audience. I've used all of these on occasion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A way to solve polynomials</strong></p>\n\n<p>We came up with equations like <code>x - 5 = 0, what is x?</code>, and the naturals solved them (easily). Then we asked, ""wait, what about <code>x + 5 = 0</code>?"" So we invented negative numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about <code>2x = 1</code>?"" So we invented rational numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about <code>x^2 = 2</code>?"" so we invented irrational numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we asked, ""wait, what about <code>x^2 = -1</code>?"" This is the only question that was left, so we decided to invent the ""imaginary"" numbers to solve it. All the other numbers, at some point, didn't exist and didn't seem ""real"", but now they're fine. Now that we have imaginary numbers, we can solve every polynomial, so it makes sense that that's the last place to stop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pairs of numbers</strong></p>\n\n<p>This explanation goes the route of redefinition. Tell the listener to forget everything he knows about imaginary numbers. You're defining a new number system, only now there are always pairs of numbers. Why? For fun. Then go through explaining how addition/multiplication work. Try and find a good ""realistic"" use of pairs of numbers (many exist).</p>\n\n<p>Then, show that in this system,  <code>(0,1) * (0,1) = (-1,0)</code>, in other words, we've defined a new system, under which it makes sense to say that <code>sqrt(-1) = i</code>, when <code>i=(0,1)</code>. And that's really all there is to imaginary numbers: a definition of a new number system, which makes sense to use in most places. And under that system, there <strong>is</strong> an answer to <code>sqrt(-1)</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The historical explanation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Explain the history of the imaginary numbers. Showing that mathematicians <em>also</em> fought against them for a long time helps people understand the mathematical process, i.e., that it's all definitions in the end.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a little rusty, but I think there were certain equations that kept having parts of them which used <code>sqrt(-1)</code>, and the mathematicians kept  throwing out the equations since there is no such thing.</p>\n\n<p>Then, one mathematician decided to just ""roll with it"", and kept working, and found out that all those square roots cancelled each other out.</p>\n\n<p>Amazingly, the answer that was left was the <strong>correct answer</strong> (he was working on finding roots of polynomials, I think).

"<p>We will will first consider the most common definition of i, as the square root of -1. When you first hear this, it sounds crazy. 0 squared is 0; a positive times a positive is positive and a negative times a negative is positive too. So there doesn't actually appear to be any number that we can square to get -1.</p>\n\n<p>A mathematician would collectively term 0, negative numbers and positive numbers as the real numbers. They would also define the term complex numbers as a group of numbers that includes these real numbers. So while we have shown that no real number can square to get -1, we haven't even defined complex numbers at this point, so we can't rule out that one might have this property.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, it makes sense to ask what does a mathematician mean by a number? It certainly isn't what most people associate it with - as an abstract representation some kind of real world quantity. We need to understand that it isn't uncommon for one word to have different meanings for different groups of people - after all words mean whatever we make them mean.

It's the same for the hemisphere cross-section, as you can see by doing the Pythagorean theorem with any vector from the sphere center to a point on the sphere at height y to get the radius of the cross section (which is circular).</p>\n\n<p>Since the cylinder/cone and hemisphere have the same height, by Cavalieri's Principle the volumes of the two are equal.

"<p>Okay, so hopefully this isn't too hard or off-topic. Let's say I have a very simple lowpass filter (something that smooths out a signal), and the filter object has a position variable and a cutoff variable (between 0 and 1). In every step, a value is put into the following bit of pseudocode as ""input"": <code>position = position*(1-c)+input*c</code>, or more mathematically, <code>f(n) = f(n-1)*(1-c)+x[n]*c</code>. The output is the value of ""position."" Basically, it moves a percentage of the distance between the current position and then input value, stores this value internally, and returns it as output.

"<p>In general, we think of well-behaved functions as <strong>simpler</strong>, somehow. In any field, we might want to limit ourselves to considering only well-behaved functions in order to avoid having to deal with nasty edge cases. And in each of these domains, the community is free to choose whatever definition of 'well-behaved' makes sense for them. A quick look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-behaved"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki link</a> that <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/206/what-exactly-does-it-mean-for-a-function-to-be-well-behaved/215#215"" rel=""nofollow"">e.James posted</a> will show you the diversity in ideas of what it means to be well-behaved. I am no economist, so I will take for granted that the definition you put forth in your question is the one in common use. </p>\n\n<p>I can see <strong>twice-differentiable</strong> as a reasonable requirement for a utility function to be 'well-behaved' is because the derivative of the utility function is marginal utility, and economists often care about the derivative of marginal utility. For example, if the second derivative of utility is negative, this means that the marginal utility has a negative derivative in other words, additional quantity of the good or service does not add utility as quickly. Also commonly referred to as diminishing returns.</p>\n\n<p>If we want to be able to take the derivative even once, of course, we need the function to be <strong>continuous</strong>. You probably don't need to worry about the formal definition here. Pencil test should work fine.</p>\n\n<p>The requirement for utility to be <strong>monotonic</strong> means that it is either always increasing or always decreasing. In other words, that a particular good or service is either desirable or not. If 10 widgets were good, 20 must be better. Of course, as mentioned above, maybe not <em>that</em> much better.</p>\n\n<p>Monotonic means that it will also be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function#Properties"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>quasi-concave</strong></a>.

"<p>I'm not a real Mathematician, just an enthusiast. I'm often in the situation where I want to learn some interesting Maths through a good book, but not through an actual Maths textbook. I'm also often trying to give people good Maths books to get them ""hooked"".</p>\n\n<p>So the question: What is a good book, for laymen, which teaches interesting Mathematics, but actually does it in a ""real"" way. For example, ""Fermat's Last Enigma"" doesn't count, since it doesn't actually feature any Maths, just a story, and most textbook don't count, since they don't feature a story.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite example of this is ""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/014014739X"" rel=""nofollow"">Journey Through Genius</a>"", which is a brilliant combination of interesting storytelling and large amounts of actual Mathematics. It took my love of Maths to a whole other level.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>A few more details on what I'm looking for.</p>\n\n<p>The audience of ""laymen"" should be anyone who has the ability (and desire) to understand actual mathematics, but does not want to learn from a textbook. Obviously I'm thinking about myself here, as a programmer who loves mathematics, I love being exposed to real maths, but I'm not going to get into it seriously. That's why books that show actual maths, but give a lot more exposition (and much clearer explanations, especially of what the intuition should be) are great.</p>\n\n<p>When I say ""real maths"", I'm talking about actual proofs, formulas, or other mathematical theories. Specifically, I'm not talking about philosophy, nor am I talking about books which <strong>only</strong> talk about the history of mats (Simon Singh style), since they only talk <em>about</em> maths, they don't actually show anything. William Dunham's books and Paul J. Nahin's books are good examples.</p>\n"	"2605"	"Best Maths books for non-mathematicians"	"2010-11-30T17:31:47.517"	"2"	"18"	""	"12"	"1"	"122"	"<soft-question><big-list><reference-request>"	"2010-07-21T07:12:50.247"	"24"	"275"	"122"	""	"2010-07-21T22:25:14.570"	"2010-07-21T07:12:50.247"	""	""

"<p>From <a href=""http://www.helium.com/items/895074-comparing-matlab-and-mathematica"">helium.com</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The comparison between Matlab and\n  Mathematica is NOT numeric versus\n  symbolic as some claim. It is 'high\n  level complete system' versus 'low\n  level core with specialist toolboxes'.\n  Mathematica can do all the numeric\n  math and matrix work that Matlab can\n  do, as fast and as accurately. Matlab\n  is almost strictly a subset of the\n  functionality of Mathematica.</p>\n  \n  <p>Much of the wider functionality for\n  Matlab is sold as additional\n  toolboxes. e.g. Matlab has toolboxes\n  for curve fitting, statistics,\n  optimization, symbolic math, PDEs,\n  Image acquisition etc but ALL of these\n  areas of functionality are built in to\n  Mathematica already. Aside from the\n  cost and inconvenience of making you\n  buy every function that you need\n  separately, the Matlab design means\n  that the core is inherently low level\n  (since it cannot call on any of the\n  toolbox functionality in case you have\n  not purchased that toolbox), and many\n  of these functions do not fit well\n  together (e.g. no toolbox function can\n  be used with symbolic parameters as\n  they are all written using the\n  numeric-only Matlab core).</p>\n  \n  <p>Matlab's only comparative strength\n  lies in some of its specialist\n  toolboxes (e.g. control theory where\n  it is dominant) but if you are not in\n  that specialism, those are of no use.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some specific differences between the\n  core systems:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Matlab is machine precision numeric only with some support for complex\n  arithmetic - all Mathematica functions\n  support machine precision and\n  arbitrary precision real and complex\n  arithmetic, exact arithmetic and\n  symbolic computation.</li>\n  <li>Matlab basic data model is 2D (matrices) with a pointer mechanism to\n  emulate higher dimensions -\n  Mathematica basic data model handles\n  any dimensionality without extra work.</li>\n  <li>Many of Mathematica's functions switch automatically between different\n  algorithms (with a manual overide) -\n  in Matlab you must always choose the\n  algorithm.</li>\n  <li>Matlab requires you to manually linearize ODEs to a system of first\n  order equations before it can solve\n  them - Mathematica accepts any order\n  ODE.</li>\n  <li>Matlab can do integration up to only three dimensions (with\n  triplequad) Mathematica handles\n  n-dimensional integration for any n.</li>\n  <li>Matlab's language is procedural only (rather like higher level\n  FORTRAN) - Mathematica allows\n  programming in procedural, functional,\n  object oriented and rule based styles.</li>\n  <li>Matlab has text interface and a basic home grown IDE - Mathematica has\n  text interface, document interface,\n  GUI tools, and full Eclipse based IDE.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n"	""	""	"2010-08-16T07:10:58.270"	"8"	""	""	"19"	"2"	"97"	""	"2010-07-21T07:20:11.040"	""	"277"	"97"	""	"2010-08-16T07:10:58.270"	""	"153"	""

Usual operations applied on a point include translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, skewing and combination of these. </p>\n\n<p>These transformations can be represented by a mathematical object called ""matrix"". A matrix applies on a vector like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ a b c tx ] [ x ]   [ a*x + b*y + c*z + tx*w ]\n| d e f ty | | y | = | d*x + e*y + f*z + ty*w |\n| g h i tz | | z |   | g*x + h*y + i*z + tz*w |\n[ p q r s  ] [ w ]   [ p*x + q*y + r*z +  s*w ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For example, scaling is represented as</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ 2 . . . ] [ x ]   [ 2x ]\n| . 2 . . | | y | = | 2y |\n| . . 2 . | | z |   | 2z |\n[ . . . 1 ] [ 1 ]   [ 1  ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and translation as</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ 1 . . dx ] [ x ]   [ x + dx ]\n| . 1 . dy | | y | = | y + dy |\n| . . 1 dz | | z |   | z + dz |\n[ . . . 1  ] [ 1 ]   [   1    ]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em><strong>One of the reason for the 4th component is to make a translation representable by a matrix.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>The advantage of using a matrix is that multiple transformations can be combined into one via matrix multiplication.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if the purpose is simply to bring translation on the table, then I'd say (x, y, z, 1) instead of (x, y, z, w) and make the last row of the matrix always <code>[0 0 0 1]</code>, as done usually for 2D graphics.

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. </p>\n\n<p>Why's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\\prod (x+\\zeta_p^iy) = z^p$ for $\\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$.  So if $p>3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).</p>\n\n<p>Lame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these ""generalized integers"" $Z[\\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this <a href=""http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>, Dedekind was the first to define a ring.</p>\n\n<p>The article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-08-07T20:34:33.857"	"11"	""	""	"10"	"2"	"536"	""	"2010-07-21T17:22:25.990"	""	"363"	"536"	""	"2010-08-07T20:34:33.857"	""	"362"	""

"<p>Here's my best shot at the sort of explanation you're asking for, although it's not nearly as clear as the 2-by-n case.  The negative sign makes combinatorial proofs difficult, so let's rearrange this as</p>\n\n<p>f(n) + f(n-2) = 4f(n-1).</p>\n\n<p>Then you want to show that the number of n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is four times the number of (n-1)-tilings. (An ""n-tiling"" is a tiling of a 3 by 2n rectangle by dominoes.)</p>\n\n<p>In bijective terms, then, we want a bijection between the set of n-tilings and (n-2)-tilings and the set of (n-1)-tilings, where the (n-1)-tilings are each tagged with the number 1, 2, 3, or 4.</p>\n\n<p>Given an (n-1)-tiling, there are three ""obvious"" ways to obtain an n-tiling from it, namely by adding one of the three 1-tilings on the right end.  These generate tilings which have a vertical line passing all the way through,  two units from the right end; call these ""faulted"" tilings, and those which don't have a vertical line in that position ""faultless"".<br>\nSo it suffices to show that the number of faultless n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is the number of (n-1)-tilings.  It's easy to see that the number of faultless n-tilings is 2g(n-2); a faultless tilings must have a horizontal domino covering the second and third squares from the right in some row, and this assumption forces the placement of some other dominoes.  So we need 2g(n-2) + f(n-2) = f(n-1).

"<p>The question is more profound than is initially seems, and is really about algebraic structures. The first question you have to ask yourself is <em>where you're working</em>:</p>\n\n<p>In general, addition and multiplication are defined on a <em>structure</em>, which in this case  is a <em>set</em> (basically a collection of ""things"") with two <em>operators</em> we call <em>addition</em> (marked $+$) and <em>multiplication</em> (marked $\\cdot$ or $\\times$ or $\\ast$ or whatever). If this structure holds some properties, which are sometimes called <em>axioms</em>, then it is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_ring"" rel=""nofollow"">unit ring</a>. The properties are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The set is closed under the operator $+$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a+b$ is also in $R$.</li>\n<li>The set has a member which we mark as $0$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a+0 = 0$ and $0+a = 0$.</li>\n<li>The operation $+$ is commutative: $a+b = b+a$.</li>\n<li>The operation $+$ is associative: $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$.</li>\n<li>Every member has an additive inverse: for every $a$ in $R$ there is some $b$ in $R$ such that $a+b = 0$ (we mark $b$ as $-a$).</li>\n<li>The set is closed under the operator $*$. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $R$, then $a*b$ is also in $R$.</li>\n<li>The set has a member which we mark as $1$. It has the properties that for every $a$ in $R$, $a*1 = a$ and $1*a = a$.</li>\n<li>The operation $*$ is associative: $(a*b) * c = a * (b*c)$.</li>\n<li>Multiplication is distributive over addition: $a * (b+c) = a*b + a*c$ and $(a+b) * c = a*b + a*c$. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this is a long list, and introduces the operator $+$ which is not even explicitly mentioned in the question, these properties are quite natural. For example, the integers $\\{ \\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ we all know and love indeed form a ring. The real numbers also form a ring  (in fact they form a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">field</a>, which means they hold even more properties).</p>\n\n<p>In regard to your question, the identity $x * 1 = x$ (I assume that's what you meant) is in fact an axiom - it is axiom 7. However, the other two identities are results of the other axioms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First identity:</strong> We use axioms 2 and 9 to get  $0 * x = (0+0) * x = 0*x + 0*x$  and then by adding $-(0*x)$ (the additive inverse of $0*x$, from axiom 5) to both sides,  $0 = 0*x$.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second identity:</strong> As stated in axiom 5, $-(-x)$ is just a notation used which means ""the additive inverse of $-x$"". To show that $-(-x) = x$ we need to show that $x$ is in fact the additive inverse of $-x$, or in other words that $x + -x = 0$ and $-x + x = 0$. But that's just what axiom 5 says, so we're done.</p>\n\n<p>Last point: You might be wondering why did we have to go and introduce addition to answer a question about multiplication? Well, it so happens that without addition the other two identities are simply not true. For example, if we look at the positive integers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ with only multiplication, then there is no $0$ there! Simply put, this is because the positive integers do not form a ring.</p>\n"	""	""	"2011-12-30T06:58:51.390"	""	""	""	"10"	"2"	"26"	""	"2010-07-21T20:28:20.760"	""	"379"	"13425"	""	"2011-12-30T06:58:51.390"	""	"375"	""

"<p>Mathematics is the art of clever forgetting.  The first mathematical breakthrough, numbers, came about when people realized that if you just forgot about whether it was 5 cows + 3 cows, or 5 rocks + 3 rocks or whatever you always got 8.

Then near $p$, we can write $f$ as $q$ basically something linear plus some ""noise"" which ""doesn't matter"" (i.e. is little oh of the distance to $p$).

"<p>When I used to compete in Olympiad Competitions back in high school, a decent number of the easier geometry questions were solvable by what we called a geometry bash.

It seems like the kind of thing you could program a computer to do. So, I'm curious, does there exist any software to do this? I know there is lots of software for solving equations, but is there anything that lets you actually input a geometry problem without manually converting to equations?

For every P appears in E, substitute it with another relation using other points from L(P itself is also allowed), usually if we are proving about lengths, we might use area. A list of possible operations are required for this step. It can branches off as a proof tree when the program decide to use different substitutions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do another substitution that eliminates the point P.

"<p>An extreme form of constructivism is called <em>finitisim</em>.  In this form, unlike the standard axiom system, infinite sets are not allowed.  There are important mathematicians, such as Kronecker, who supported such a system.  I can see that the natural numbers and rational numbers can easily defined in a finitist system, by easy adaptations of the standard definitions.   But in order to do any significant mathematics, we need to have definitions for the irrational numbers that one is likely to encounter in practice, such as  e  or sqrt(2).  In standard constructions, real numbers are defined as Dedekind cuts, or Cauchy sequences, which are actually sets of infinite cardinality, so they are of no use here. My question is, how would a real number like those be defined in a finitist axiom system.  (Of course we have no hope to construct the entire set of real numbers, since that set is uncountably infinite.) </p>\n\n<p>After doing a little research  I found a constructivist definition in Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)#Example_from_real_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)#Example_from_real_analysis</a> , but we need a finitist definition of a function for this definition to work.

"<p>There is a fragment of mathematics that is given by a set of axioms known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms"" rel=""nofollow"">Peano axioms</a>. Using these rules you can carry out a vast amount of mathematics relating to natural numbers. For example you can prove lots of theorems in number theory using these axioms. The Peano axioms make no reference to sets at all, whether finite or infinite. The only things that exist in this theory are naturals. You can't even form the set of all integers. You can only talk about the naturals themselves. So a vast amount of mathematics would work absolutely fine.</p>\n\n<p>Even though Peano's axioms are about naturals, you can already use them to talk about finite sets. The idea is that any finite set could be encoded as a finite sequence of symbols which in turn could be represented as naturals using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering"" rel=""nofollow"">Godel numbering</a>. So questions like ""is this set a subset of that one?"" could be turned into purely arithmetical statements about Godel numbers.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm pretty sure that declaring that there is no infinite set would make little difference to people working within the system defined by Peano's axioms. We'd still have all of the natural numbers to work with, we just wouldn't be able to assemble them into a single entity, the set of all natural numbers.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there are theorems that make essential use of an infinite set. Like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">Goodstein's theorem</a>. Without infinite sets (or a substitute of some sort) it would be impossible to prove this result.</p>\n\n<p>So the overall result would be, I think, that you could still do lots of mathematics fine. The mathematics you could do wouldn't be all that weird. And you'd simply be depriving yourself of a useful proof technique.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, you'd still be able to say many things about real numbers. A real number can be thought of as a Cauchy sequence. A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_sequence"" rel=""nofollow"">Cauchy sequence</a> is a certain type of sequence of rational numbers. So many statements about real numbers, when unpacked, are really statements about rational, and hence naturals, but in disguise.</p>\n\n<p>Update: Uncovering precisely what parts of mathematics you need in order to prove things is a field known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">reverse mathematics</a>. Hilbert, and others mathematicians, were interested in trying to prove as much mathematics as possible using finite methods.

So 10 would correspond to the set with ten things -- like a bag of ten stones. Pretty straight forward.</p>\n\n<p>The tricky part is that when we consider ten a subset of the real numbers, we actually redefine it. This is not emphasized even in higher mathematics classes, like real analysis; it just happens when we define the real numbers. </p>\n\n<p>So what is 10 when constructed in the real numbers? Well, at least with the Dedekind cut version of the real numbers, <strong>all</strong> real numbers correspond to a set with an infinite amount of elements. This makes 10 under the hood look drastically different, although in practice it operates exactly the same.</p>\n\n<p>So let's return to the question: Why is 10 the same as 9.99999? Because the real numbers have this completely surprising quality, where there is no next real number. So when you have two real numbers that are as close together as possible, they are the same.

"<p>I do not think that 0.999... = 1 unless we're defining the equality operator in some strange way.

Otherwise we'd have to give 0.999.. some unusual properties like automatically increasing the number of nines when it is multiplied.  It would not be just an ordinary number.

First we only look at the absolute values. Let us try to calculate the probability of this never exceeding x. The probability of 2x+1 consecutive moves all being the same is some p>0. If this ever occurs, then the absolute value will exceed x. Consider n groups of 2x+1 moves, the probability that at least one of these is all the same is 1-(1-p)^n, which approaches 1.

"<p>In a nutshell, a Markov chain is (the behavior of) a random process which may only find itself in a (not necessarily finite) number of different states. The process moves from a state to another in discrete times (that is, you define a sequence S(t) of states at time t=0,1,2,...), and for which the probability of going from state S to state R depends just from S and R; that is, there is no ""memory of the past"" and the process is ""timeless"". This means that the Markov chain may be modeled as a n*n matrix, where n is the number of possible states. </p>\n\n<p>An example of a process which may be modeled by a Markov chain is the sequence of faces of a die showing up, if you are allowed to rotate the die wrt an edge.

"<p>Ultrafinitism is basically resource-bounded  constructivism: proofs have constructive content, and what you get out of these constructions isn't much more than you put in.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at the universal and existential quantifier should help clarify things.

Ultrafinitistically, the thing you give back won't be much bigger: typically there will be a polynomial bound on the size of what you get back.</p>\n\n<p>For existentially quantified statements, the constructive content is a pair of the value of the parameter, and the construction that satisfies the predicate.

Just as an intuitionist might be bothered by the idea of cutting a ball into non-measurable pieces and putting them back together into two balls, so too  an ultrafinitist might be concerned about the idea that towers of exponentials are meaningful ways of constructing numbers.  Wittgenstein argued this point in his ""Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics"".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Can you actually get math done from that perspective?</strong> Yes.

Consider the simple random walk which makes steps to the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest with equal probability. The projections of this walk onto the x- and y-axes are independent simple random walks in one dimension.

This is asymptotic to $1/(\\pi n)$, and the expected number of returns to the origin is the $\\sum_{n \\geq 1} \\rho_2(2n)$, so the expected number of returns to the origin is infinite. It's not hard to show (and is in fact true, but the proof is unenlightening so I'll leave it to Durrett) that in this case the probability of eventually returning to the origin is $1$.</p>\n"	""	""	"2011-08-25T20:54:39.953"	"1"	""	""	"17"	"2"	"173"	""	"2010-07-23T12:01:33.107"	""	"563"	"1277"	""	"2011-08-25T20:54:39.953"	""	"536"	""

"<p>Edited to clear some things up:</p>\n\n<p>Simplicial and singular (co)homology were invented to detect holes in spaces.  To get an intuitive idea of how this works, consider subspaces of the plane.  Here the 2-chains are formal sums of things homeomorphic to the closed disk, and 1-chains are formal sums of things homeomorphic to a line segment.  The operator d takes the boundary of a chain.  For example, the boundary of the closed disk is a circle.  If we take d of the circle we get 0 since a circle has no boundary.  And in general it happens that d^2 = 0, that is boundaries always have no boundaries themselves.  Now suppose we remove the origin from the plane and take a circle around the origin.  This circle is in the kernel of d since it has no boundary.  However, it does not bound any 2-chain in the space (since the origin is removed) and so it is not in the image of the boundary operator on two-dimensions.  Thus the circle represents a non-trivial element in the quotient space ker d / im d.</p>\n\n<p>The way I have defined things makes the above a homology theory simply because the d operator decreases dimension.  Cohomology is the same thing only the operator increases dimension (for example the exterior derivative on differential forms).  Thus algebraically there really is no difference between cohomology and homology since we can just change the grading from i to -i.  </p>\n\n<p>From a homology we can get a corresponding cohomology theory by dualizing, that is by looking at maps from the group of chains to the underlying group (e.g. Z or R).  Then d on the cohomology theory becomes the adjoint of the previous boundary operator and thus increases degrees.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-23T15:05:02.630"	""	""	""	"6"	"2"	"9"	""	"2010-07-23T14:52:06.373"	""	"579"	"9"	""	"2010-07-23T15:05:02.630"	""	"573"	""

"<p>Broadly speaking, algebraic geometry is used a lot in some areas of robotics and mechanical engineering.

"<blockquote>\n  <p>A 10-year loan of $500 is repaid with\n  payments at the end of each year.

Since the payments are 1.5x the 10% interest, it's just like paying off 5% of the principal each year! This saves me a lot of time, because I can just set <code>I/Y=-5</code> and get <code>FV=598.74</code> on my calculator. I did it the long way by calculating the future value of each interest payment (turns out they were not all $75, because the outstanding principal got smaller), and they were the same. Is this always going to work, or did I just get lucky here?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Another update!<br>\nI think I solved it. All I needed to do was to set <code>FV=0</code>, <code>I/Y=10</code>, <code>N=10</code>, <code>PV=598.74</code>, and then I got <code>PMT=97.44</code>.

"<p><em><strong>edit</strong> (2010-07-26)</em>: The question is much more involved than I'd originally thought.  As implied in the question, I knew that congruence and similarity transformations are constructible.  Immediately below this section is my original answer, which only demonstrates congruence transformations and was intended more to give an idea of what an answer might look like (since, at the time, there was another answer that was not particularly helpful).  In the last section of this answer is my justification that all affine transformations of the plane are constructible.  In re-reading that now, I realize that I'd assumed the ability to construct a point, say $P&#39;$, on a line, say $\\overleftrightarrow{RP}$, such that $\\frac{RP&#39;}{RP}$ is equal to some known ratio.  This is equivalent to being able to construct the dilation of $P$ by the known ratio about center $R$.  I've added the construction of such a dilation below the congruence transformation section.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>edit</strong> (2012-01-28)</em>:  A conversation with some colleagues reminded me about this problem and in starting to ask them about it, I realized I'd completely missed that all <strong>M\xf6bius transformations</strong> are constructible.  Since any M\xf6bius transformation can be expressed as a composition of translation, reflection, inversion, dilation, rotation, and translation (I think there's a typical decomposition that's roughly in that order, hence my listing translation twice).  The only one of these that I have not yet shown is constructible is inversion, so I have appended that construction.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As a partial answer, here are constructions of the basic congruence transformations, assuming basic construction techniques like constructing a line parallel or perpendicular to a given line through a given point and angle-copying:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>reflection</strong>  Given a point $P$ and a line $\\ell$, construct the line perpendicular to $\\ell$ through $P$, and construct the circle centered at the intersection of this new line and $\\ell$ and passing through $P$.

"<p>I just got out from my Math and Logic class with my friend.  During the lecture, a well-known math/logic puzzle was presented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The King has $1000$ wines, $1$ of which is poisoned.  He needs to identify the poisoned wine as soon as possible, and with the least resources, so he hires the protagonist, a Mathematician.  The king offers you his expendable servants to help you test which wine is poisoned.</p>\n  \n  <p>The poisoned wine is very potent, so much that one molecule of the wine will cause anyone who drinks it to die.  However, it is slow-acting.  The nature of the slow-acting poison means that there is only time to test one ""drink"" per servant. (A drink may be a mixture of any number of wines)  (Assume that the King needs to know within an hour, and that any poison in the drink takes an hour to show any symptoms)</p>\n  \n  <p>What is the minimum amount of servants you would need to identify the poisoned wine?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With enough time and reasoning, one can eventually see that this requires at most <strong>ten</strong> ($10$) servants (in fact, you could test 24 more wines on top of that 1000 before requiring an eleventh servant).  The proof/procedure is left to the reader.</p>\n\n<p>My friend and I, however, was not content with resting upon this answer.  My friend added the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What would be different if there were $2$ wines that were poisoned out of the 1000?  What is the new minimum then?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We eventually generalized the problem to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given $N$ bottles of wine ($N \\gt 1$) and, of those, $k$ poisoned wines  ($0 \\lt k \\lt N$), what is the optimum method to identify the all of the poisoned wines, and how many servants are required ($s(N,k)$)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After some mathsing, my friend and I managed to find some (possibly unhelpful) lower and upper bounds:</p>\n\n<p>$ log_2 {N \\choose k} \\le s(N,k) \\le N-1 $</p>\n\n<p>This is because $log_2 {N \\choose k}$ is the minimum number of servants to uniquely identify the $N \\choose k$ possible configurations of $k$ poisoned wines in $N$ total wines.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone help us find an optimum strategy?  Besides the trivial one requiring $N-1$ servants.  How about a possible approach to start?</p>\n\n<p>Would this problem be any different if you were only required to find a strategy that would for sure find a wine that is <strong>not</strong> poisoned, instead of identifying all poisoned wines?

"<p>The answer to this question depends on how the problem is defined, but the answer is no, at least without defining the problem in a misleading way.</p>\n\n<p>Since my first solution was completely off the mark, I have deleted it and posted this new one.</p>\n\n<p>Consider polynomial p. If it has an integer solution, then the solution will eventually be found by random guessing. So if it is impossible to prove the existential status, there must be no solution.</p>\n\n<p>Now we know from this link that there is a polynomial, q, that is unsolvable in the integers iff ZFC is consistent. It is well known that ZFC cannot prove its own consistency. So if it ZFC is consistent, then q is unsolvable, but we cannot prove this as then we could prove ZFC. So it seems like it is accurate to say that if mathematics is consistent, we have a polynomial with no integer roots, but we can't prove it. However, if we are assuming maths is consistent, we can use this to prove that the equation is unsolvable (indeed that is what we have done). So, it really isn't accurate an accurate statement at all. </p>\n\n<p>To further clarify, when considering mathematical truth, there are two basic ways of viewing it. The first is where we are assuming that are axioms are true, which necessarily means assuming consistency. If we show any problem is equivalent to consistency, then we consider it to be true.</p>\n\n<p>The other is where we are considering a formal set of statements, of which the axioms have been defined to be true and seeing which statements can be derived to be true. From this viewpoint, we don't actually know whether the axioms are consistent or not. In fact, Godel's second incompleteness theorem shows that no ""non-trivial"" atomic system can prove its own consistency. So showing a problem is equivalent to consistency is actually the same as showing that the problem is unprovable by the atomic system.</p>\n\n<p>The confusion comes from assuming ZFC is consistent to eliminate one possibility in a choice, yet not allowing this assumption to be used as an axiom in the proofs.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-24T19:39:04.343"	"3"	""	""	"0"	"2"	"123"	""	"2010-07-24T16:16:57.587"	""	"648"	"123"	""	"2010-07-24T19:39:04.343"	""	"434"	""

The problem is, this isn't a homomorphism in the category of vector spaces; it is rather a bilinear map. So you can think of it as a map $V \\otimes V^* \\to k$ instead.  This is why you need a tensor structure to think of duals.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't enough, though, because we need to know that the pairing is nondegenerate.  One way to express this is that there's a map $k \\to V \\times V^*$ mapping 1 to the ""Casimir element"" (which is the sum $\\sum e_i \\otimes e_i^{\\vee}$ where $e_i$ ranges over a basis of $V$ and $e_i^{\\vee}$ the dual basis; it is independent of the choice of $e_i$ as a quick computation shows).  The Casimir morphism satisfies the condition that $V \\to (k) \\otimes V \\to (V \\otimes V^*) \\otimes V \\to V \\otimes (V^* \\otimes V)$ is just the identity.<br>\nConversely, this is enough to show that the pairing is nondegenerate.  </p>\n\n<p>So, anyway, how does this make sense in a symmetric tensor category?

"<p>Seeing an expression like $I = \\int r^2 dm$ is certainly confusing the first time you see it. When you see an expression like $I = \\int x^2 dx$ we effectively iterating over a range on the x axis and adding up the area of an infinite amount of infinitesimally small strips. Note that the area of each strip is approximated as the function value (x^2) times the strip length (dx). When you see an expression like dm, we are iterating over masses instead. We still sum up the function value (r^2), but this time we multiply it by the strip mass (dm). To solve the problem, we usually put m in terms of another variable which we can iterate over more easily.</p>\n\n<p>For example, consider the moment of inertia of a rod of length L around its center with total mass of L. Each bit of length (dx) has mass (dm) and r=|x|. Solving for $I = \\int r^2 dm = \\int |x|^2 dx = \\int x^2 dx = (x^3)/3+c$. Now, we have definite values for x to sub in (-L/2 and L/2), so we write <code>I=(L/8)/3-(-L/8)/3=L/12</code></p>\n\n<p>Now lets calculate the moment of inertia of the hoop case you described. We break the hoop up into infinitesimally small rings the same distance from the center. Let the hoop have inner thickness r and outer thickness R. The area is <code>R^2-r^2</code>. The area density, d, is therefore <code>m/(R^2-r^2)</code>. A ring at radius k with thickness dk has area <code>2pi k dk</code>, mass is <code>2pi k dk * m/(R^2-r^2)</code> and moment of inertia around the central axis <code>2pi k^3 dk * m/(R^2-r^2)</code>. The integral is <code>pi/2*k^4 *m/(R^2-r^2)+c</code>.

"<p>In my linear algebra class, we just talked about determinants. So far I\u2019ve been understanding the material okay, but now I\u2019m very confused.

"<p>Your trouble with determinants is pretty common. They\u2019re a hard thing to teach well, too, for two main reasons that I can see: the formulas you learn for computing them are messy and complicated, and there\u2019s no \u201cnatural\u201d way to interpret the value of the determinant, the way it\u2019s easy to interpret the derivatives you do in calculus at first as the slope of the tangent line. It\u2019s hard to believe things like the invertibility condition you\u2019ve stated when it\u2019s not even clear what the numbers mean and where they come from.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than show that the many usual definitions are all the same by comparing them to each other, I\u2019m going to state some general properties of the determinant that I claim are enough to specify uniquely what number you should get when you put in a given matrix. Then it\u2019s not too bad to check that all of the definitions for determinant that you\u2019ve seen satisfy those properties I\u2019ll state.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to think about if you want an \u201cabstract\u201d definition of the determinant to unify all those others is that it\u2019s not an array of numbers with bars on the side. What we\u2019re really looking for is a function that takes N vectors (the N columns of the matrix) and returns a number. Let\u2019s assume we\u2019re working with real numbers for now.</p>\n\n<p>Remember how those operations you mentioned change the value of the determinant? </p>\n\n<p>(1) Switching two rows or columns changes the sign. </p>\n\n<p>(2) Multiplying one row by a constant multiplies the whole determinant by that constant. </p>\n\n<p>(3) The general fact that number two draws from: the determinant is <em>linear in each row</em>. That is, if you think of it as a function $\\det: \\mathbb{R}^{n^2} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, then $ \\det(a \\vec{v_1} +b \\vec{w_1}, \\vec{v_2},...,\\vec{v_n}) = a \\det(\\vec{v_1},\\vec{v_2},...,\\vec{v_n}) + b \\det(\\vec{w_1}, \\vec{v_2}, ...,\\vec{v_n})$, and the corresponding condition in each other slot.</p>\n\n<p>I claim that these facts, together with the fact that the determinant of the identity matrix is one, is enough to define a <em>unique function</em> that takes in N vectors (each of length N) and returns a real number, the determinant of the matrix given by those vectors. I won\u2019t prove that, but I\u2019ll show you how it helps with some other interpretations of the determinant.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, there\u2019s a nice geometric way to think of a determinant. Consider the unit cube in N dimensional space: the set of vectors of length N with coordinates 0 or 1 in each spot. The determinant of the linear transformation (matrix) T is the <em>signed volume of the region gotten by applying T to the unit cube</em>. (Don\u2019t worry too much if you don\u2019t know what the \u201csigned\u201d part means, for now).</p>\n\n<p>How does that follow from our abstract definition?</p>\n\n<p>Well, if you apply the identity to the unit cube, you get back the unit cube. And the volume of the unit cube is 1.</p>\n\n<p>If you stretch the cube by a constant factor in one direction only, the new volume is that constant. And if you stack two blocks together aligned on the same direction, their combined volume is the sum of their volumes: this all shows that the signed volume we have is linear in each coordinate when considered as a function of the input vectors.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when you switch two of the vectors that define the unit cube, you flip the orientation. (Again, this is something to come back to later if you don\u2019t know what that means).</p>\n\n<p>So there are ways to think about the determinant that aren\u2019t symbol-pushing. If you\u2019ve studied multivariable calculus, you could think about, with this geometric definition of determinant, why determinants (the Jacobian) pop up when we change coordinates doing integration. Hint: a derivative is a linear approximations of the associated function, and consider a \u201cdifferential volume element\u201d in your starting coordinate system.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s not too much work to check that the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $\\det((a,b),(c,d))$, either: you might try that to get a sense for things.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-11-14T18:37:07.847"	"7"	""	""	"58"	"2"	"76"	""	"2010-07-25T02:25:45.523"	""	"669"	"900"	""	"2010-11-14T18:37:07.847"	"2010-07-25T06:05:47.733"	"668"	""

The global minimum of this surface lies at the origin (at $x=0$, $y=0$).  If we are given the constraint, a requirement on the relationship between $x$ and $y$, that $3x+y=6$, then the origin can no longer be our solution (since $3\\cdot 0 + y \\cdot 0 \\neq 6$).  Yet, there is a lowest point on this function satisfying the given constraint. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What we have so far:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Objective function: $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$, <br>\nsubject to: $3x+y=6$.</p>\n\n<p>From here we can derive the Lagrange formulation of our constrained minimization problem.  This will be a function $L$ of $x$, $y$, and a single Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$ (since we have only a single constraint). <em>It will be this new function that we minimize.</em></p>\n\n<p>$L(x,y,\\lambda) = x^2 + y^2 + \\lambda(3x+y-6)$</p>\n\n<p>The Lagrange formulation incorporates our original function along with our constraint(s).  On the way toward minimizing $L$, we will have to minimize the objective function $x^2 + y^2$, as well as minimize the contribution from the constraint, which is now weighted by a factor of $\\lambda$.  If the constraint is met, then the expression $3x+y-6$ will necessarily be zero, and will not contribute anything the value of $L$. This is the <em>trick</em> of the technique.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Minimizing the Lagrange formulation:</strong></p>\n\n<p>To minimize $L$ we simply find the $x,y$, and $\\lambda$ values that make its gradient zero.

The solution will be a vector holding values for $x, y$ and $\\lambda$.

"<p>Complex numbers are the final step in a sequence of increasingly ""unreal"" extensions to the number system that humans have found it necessary to add over the centuries in order to express significant numerical concepts.</p>\n\n<p>The first such ""unreal number"" was zero, back in the mists of time. It seems obvious to us now, but it must have seemed strange at first. How can the number of sheep I have be zero, when I don't actually have any sheep?</p>\n\n<p>Negative numbers are the next most obvious addition to the family of numbers. But what does it mean to have -2 apples? If I have 3 apples and you have 5, it's convenient to be able to say that I have -2 more apples than you. Even so, during the middle ages many mathematicians were very uncomfortable with the idea of negative numbers and tried to arrange their equations so that they didn't occur.</p>\n\n<p>Rationals (fractions) seem real enough, since I'm happy to have 2/5 of a pizza. However, this is not the number of pizzas that I have, just a ratio between 0 and 1 pizzas, and so is further removed from the concept of counting.</p>\n\n<p>More significant philosophical problems problems arose when irrational numbers were first discovered by the classical Greeks. They were astonished when Euclid (or one of his predecessors) proved that the diagonal of a unit square could not be represented by ratio of two integers. This was such an outrageous idea to them that they called these numbers ""irrational"". However, they couldn't easily deny their existence since they have a direct geometric representation.</p>\n\n<p>Irrational numbers were first understood as the solutions to algebraic equations such as x^2 = 2 but this still doesn't cover all the possible numbers that we need. For example, the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference is \u03c0 and so has a direct geometric representation. However, in 1882 \u03c0 was proved to be transcendental, meaning that it can't be defined as the solution to a specific algebraic equation. This begins to seem a lot less ""real"", especially when you consider that there are many important transcendental numbers that, unlike \u03c0, don't have a geometric interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>There are of course many algebraic equations that don't have a solution even among the irrational numbers, and in some ways there's no reason why they should. However, when 16th century mathematicians like Gerolamo Cardano began working on solutions to cubic equations they found that the square roots of negative numbers began cropping up very naturally in their procedures, even though the solutions themselves were purely real. This eventually led people to explore the arithmetic of complex numbers and they were surprised to find that it produced a consistent and beautiful theory.</p>\n\n<p>However, complex numbers don't have such an intuitively obvious geometrical meaning as the numbers that came before. They are typically represented graphically as points in the 2D plane, and the rules of addition and multiplication are equivalent to certain operations on lengths and angles, but those operations aren't driven by geometrical necessity in quite the way that squares and circles are. Even so, complex numbers are a perfect representation for various physical phenomena such as the state of particles in quantum mechanics and the behaviour of varying currents in electrical circuits. They are also very useful for reducing the cost of computation in 3D computer graphics.</p>\n\n<p>The really special thing about complex numbers, though, is that they are the end of this journey that has been going on for millenia. There is no need to invent further number systems to provide solutions to problems expressed in terms of complex numbers because now every non-contradictory equation, algebraic or transcendental, has a solution within the complex numbers. They are a self-sufficient, consistent system.</p>\n\n<p>Physicists have been breaking matter down into smaller and smaller particles over the years. Molecules, atoms, nuclei, protons, quarks. When will the process stop? For several decades it was felt that quarks could be the final, indivisible particle. However, new theoretical frameworks such as string theory are suggesting that there may be more fundamental entities than quarks. Because physics ultimately relies on experimental verification, we can never be sure that there aren't going to be more steps in the sequence.</p>\n\n<p>In mathematics, however, we can prove things for all time. Complex numbers are the final step in the sequence, the numbers that we have been reaching for since before the beginning of recorded history. Every other number system is just a subset of the complex numbers, just a part of the true picture. Complex numbers are the real thing.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-25T15:57:22.297"	"4"	""	""	"3"	"2"	"113"	""	"2010-07-25T15:57:22.297"	""	"692"	""	""	""	"2011-04-15T20:45:29.080"	"154"	""

"<p>Sure, there are variations on least-squares approximations.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an engineering answer (not really a pure math answer): On one project I did at my company, we had a thermal model that was approximating the thermal transfer function from measured power to device temperature. The cost of error in the positive direction (underestimating temperature) was worse than the cost of the same error in the negative direction (overestimating temperature) -- so we used a weighting function that was (K * error ^ 2) where K was 1 for negative temperature error and greater than 1 (e.g. 1.5 or 2) for positive temperature error.</p>\n\n<p>We thought about using more complicated mappings (10 degrees underestimate much worse than 1 degree underestimate) but didn't want to go there...

Even given a shortest chain, addition-chain exponentiation requires more memory than the binary method, because it must potentially store many previous exponents from the chain simultaneously.

"<p>While tensors are generalizations of vectors, I don't think you can really generalize the way you visualize them.  This is because you really want to think of tensors as multi-linear functions and you usually don't think of a vector as a linear function from the dual space to the real numbers.</p>\n\n<p>So even if you can't get as nice a geometric picture of a tensor, you do get a nice grasp on what they are if you view them as multi-linear functions (as opposed to just a collection of numbers) from some copies of your vector space V (and/or its dual V*) into R.  For example, a metric is a type of rank 2 tensor and has a nice geometric meaning-- applying it to two copies of a vector gives the vectors squared length, you can apply to to two vectors to get the angle between them, etc.  The moment of inertia tensor is a 2-tensor I such that I(u,u) is the moment of inertia about the u-axis.</p>\n\n<p>There are also usually different ways of looking at the same tensor, which may make it easier to get a grasp on it.  For example, a (1,1) tensor is a multilinear map from V x V* into R.  However, this can naturally (i.e. basis independently) be identified with a linear map from V to itself: if T is a (1,1) tensor then contracting it with a vector gives a linear map V* to R, which is just another vector.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-26T12:39:20.013"	""	""	""	"3"	"2"	"9"	""	"2010-07-26T12:39:20.013"	""	"724"	""	""	""	""	"713"	""

"<p>BlueRaja's answer is certainly more complete than this one (and gives good references), but here's a rough overview of linear programming.

So you do need to find an arc length but it is easy to do this without invoking calculus if you know about the dot product.  Suppose the two points on the circle are represented by the vectors v and w.  If v*w denotes the dot product of these two vectors, then the angle between them will be arccos(v*w/R^2) (we divide by R^2 since v and w have length R).

"<p>Supposing that we knew two triangles had one angle congruent, a side adjacent to the angle congruent, and the side opposite the angle congruent.

"<p>This is still WIP. There are a few missing details, still I think it's better than nothing. Feel free to edit in the missing details.</p>\n\n<p>Given a problem of <code>SUBSET-SUM</code>. We have a set of <code>A</code>={a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>} numbers, and another number <code>s</code>. The question we're seeking answer to is, whether or not there's a subset of <code>A</code> whose sum is <code>s</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm assuming that the 24-game allows you to use rational numbers. Even if it doesn't, I think that it is possible to emulate rational numbers up to denominator of size <code>p</code> with integers.</p>\n\n<p>We know that <code>SUBSET-SUM</code> is NP-complete even for integers only. I think the <code>SUBSET-SUM</code> problem is <code>NP</code>-hard even if you allow treating each a<sub>i</sub> as a negative number. That is even if <code>A</code> is of the form <code>A</code>={a<sub>1</sub>,-a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,-a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>,-a<sub>n</sub>}.

The solution is only using the <code>+</code> sign.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is, what happens if there's no solution which only uses the <code>+</code> sign, but there is a solution which uses other arithmetic operations.</p>\n\n<p>Let us consider the following problem. Let's take a prime <code>p</code> which is larger than <code>n</code>, the total number of elements in <code>A</code>. Given an oracle which solves the <code>24</code>-problem, and a <code>SUBSET-SUM</code> problem of <code>A</code>={a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,...,a<sub>n</sub>} and <code>s</code>.

The expression a<sub>i</sub>a<sub>j</sub>-a<sub>k</sub>a<sub>l</sub> will be an integer, and therefor our oracle might return answer which includes two multiplications one negative and one positive.</p>\n\n<p>What about division?

"<p>If you know some linear algebra, then here is an abstract reason: $e^x$ is the unique eigenvector of eigenvalue $1$ of the derivative $D$ acting on, say, the space of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}$.  Why is this important?  The study of solutions of linear differential equations with constant coefficients is equivalent to the study of nullspaces of operators which are polynomials in $D$, e.g. operators of the form $\\sum a_k D^k$.  Any such operator automatically commutes with $D$, so this nullspace splits up into eigenspaces of $D$.  That's why solutions to linear differential equations with constant coefficients can be expressed as sums of complex exponentials.

"<p>Answer edited, in response to the comment and a second wind for explaining mathematics:</p>\n\n<p>Let $F(x_0,x_1,x_2)=0$ be the equation for your curve, and take $(y_0,y_1,y_2)$ to be coordinates on $(\\mathbb{P}^2)^*$.  Also, assume that $F$ is irreducible and has no linear factors.</p>\n\n<p>Then $y_0 x_0+y_1 x_1+y_2 x_2=0$ is the equation of a general line in $\\mathbb{P}^2$ (recall, here $y_0,y_1,y_2$ are fixed, and the $x_i$ are the coordinates on the plane) and we look at the open set of $(\\mathbb{P}^2)^*$ where $y_2\\neq 0$.  On this open set, we can solve the equation of the line for $x_2$, and look at $g(x_0,x_1)=y_2^n F(x_0,x_1,-\\frac{1}{y_2}(y_0x_0+y_1x_1))$, a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in $x_0,x_1$ with coefficients homogeneous polynomials in the $y_i$.

"<p>Suppose you want to put a probability distribution on the natural numbers for the purpose of doing number theory.  What properties might you want such a distribution to have?  Well, if you're doing number theory then you want to think of the prime numbers as acting ""independently"": knowing that a number is divisible by $p$ should give you no information about whether it's divisible by $q$.</p>\n\n<p>That quickly leads you to the following realization: you should choose the exponent of each prime in the prime factorization independently.  So how should you choose these?  It turns out that the probability distribution on the non-negative integers with maximum entropy and a given mean is a geometric distribution, as explained for example by Keith Conrad <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/analysis/entropypost.pdf"">here</a>.  So let's take the probability that the exponent of $p$ is $k$ to be equal to $(1 - r_p) r_p^k$ for some constant $r_p$.</p>\n\n<p>This gives the probability that a positive integer $n = p_1^{e_1} ... p_k^{e_k}$ occurs as</p>\n\n<p>$\\displaystyle C \\prod_{i=1}^{k} r_p^{e_i}$</p>\n\n<p>where $C = \\prod_p (1 - r_p)$.  So we need to choose $r_p$ such that this product converges.  Now, we'd like the probability that $n$ occurs to be monotonically decreasing as a function of $n$.  It turns out (and this is a nice exercise) that this is true if and only if $r_p = p^{-s}$ for some $s &gt; 1$ (since $C$ has to converge), which gives the probability that $n$ occurs as</p>\n\n<p>$\\frac{ \\frac{1}{n^s} }{ \\zeta(s)}$</p>\n\n<p>where $\\zeta(s)$ is the zeta function.  </p>\n\n<p>One way of thinking about this argument is that $\\zeta(s)$ is the partition function of a statistical-mechanical system called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primon_gas"">Riemann gas</a>.  As $s$ gets closer to $1$, the temperature of this system increases until it would require infinite energy to make $s$ equal to $1$.  But this limit is extremely important to understand: it is the limit in which the probability distribution above gets closer and closer to uniform.  So it's not surprising that you can deduce statistical information about the primes by studying the behavior as $s \\to 1$ of this distribution.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let me mention two other reasons to care about the limit as $s \\to 1$ of the above distribution.  First, the basic reason to think of the primes as acting independently is the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  Second, a natural reason to look at a distribution where the probability that a number has exactly $k$ factors of $p$ is $(1 - p^{-1}) p^{-k}$ is that this is precisely the distribution you get on the residues $\\bmod p^n$ for $k &lt; n$.  In fact, I believe this can be upgraded to the corresponding statement about Haar measure on the $p$-adic integers.  </p>\n"	""	""	"2012-01-02T14:46:37.430"	"4"	""	""	"34"	"2"	"232"	""	"2010-07-27T22:22:26.763"	""	"832"	"6622"	""	"2012-01-02T14:46:37.430"	""	"540"	""

"<p>Hmm, apparently the other answerers' algebra classes were a lot more intense than mine...My answer's based on what I would have been comfortable with after basic algebra and geometry.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, if you think graphically, instantaneous velocity is the slope of a line at a single point rather than over an interval. At least that's what you want. So, if you happen to be going at a constant velocity (any straight line on a position graph), you can just use the slope formula. Where calculus comes in is if you're dealing with an inconstant velocity (a curved line).</p>\n\n<p>If that's not making sense right off, just try to realistically graph the movement of a car as it accelerates/decelerates, where the y-axis is position and the x-axis is time.</p>\n\n<p>Using algebra, you can't take the slope of a curved line. What you can do is take the slope between two points on the curve. The closer these points get to each other, the closer the slope between them will approximate the actual slope of the curve.

"<p>(Edit:  I have edited this answer several times because my understanding of the situation has been improving.)</p>\n\n<p>It is always profitable to understand these kind of constructions by understanding exactly what information they depend on.  The Hodge dual depends on a surprising amount of information: you need a vector space $V$ which is equipped with both an inner product and an orientation, which is essentially a choice of which bases of $V$ are ""right-handed.""  So let's see what we can say ignoring all this information first.</p>\n\n<p>Any abstract vector space $V$ of finite dimension $n$ has exterior powers $\\Lambda^2 V, \\Lambda^3 V, ... \\Lambda^n V$, the last of which is one-dimensional.  The vector spaces $\\Lambda^k V$ and $\\Lambda^{n-k} V$ always have the same dimension, so we would like to be able to define some sort of ""canonical"" map between them.  What can we say?  Well, they are always dual: the wedge product defines a natural bilinear map $\\Lambda^k V \\times \\Lambda^{n-k} V \\to \\Lambda^n V$, and since the latter is one-dimensional this means (once you've proven nondegeneracy) that the two vector spaces are in fact dual.  </p>\n\n<p>But duality does not give you a map between them.  When two vector spaces $V, W$ are dual, meaning there is a nondegenerate bilinear map $V \\times W \\to F$ (where $F$ is the ground field), all you get is an isomorphism $V \\simeq W^{\\ast}$.  Here you get an isomorphism $\\Lambda^k V \\simeq \\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\\ast}$, <strong>once you have specified an isomorphism</strong> $\\Lambda^n V \\simeq F$.  This is equivalent to picking out a distinguished vector in $\\Lambda^n V$, which there is no way to do in general.</p>\n\n<p>So the answer is to introduce extra data.  To identify $\\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\\ast}$ with $\\Lambda^{n-k} V$, we need an inner product.  An inner product gives you <strong>two</strong> distinguished vectors in $\\Lambda^n V$, as follows: take any orthonormal basis $b_1, ... b_n$.  Then wedging together the $b_i$ in any order gets you one of two elements of $\\Lambda^n V$, depending on whether the corresponding permutation is even or odd.  But without any extra data, there is no way to identify one of these elements with $1$ and one of these elements with $-1$.</p>\n\n<p>The extra data that does this is an orientation on $V$, which tells you which bases are ""right-handed"" and which are ""left-handed.""  So an oriented orthonormal basis gives you a distinguished element of $\\Lambda^n V$, which gives you a distinguished isomorphism $\\Lambda^k V \\simeq \\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\\ast}$, which composed with the isomorphism $\\Lambda^{n-k} V^{\\ast} \\simeq \\Lambda^{n-k} V$ is the Hodge dual.  </p>\n\n<p>Phew.</p>\n\n<p>This is explained in <a href=""http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~toni/hodge.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">these notes</a> I just found on Google.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T01:19:14.083"	"8"	""	""	"7"	"2"	"232"	""	"2010-07-28T01:01:41.547"	""	"881"	"232"	""	"2010-07-28T01:19:14.083"	""	"872"	""

"<p>This is a comment more than an answer, mainly in response to Qiaochu's question, but I don't have sufficient rep. to comment.</p>\n\n<p>The dual to a projective plane is the set of all lines in the plane, which itself is a\nprojective plane (as hinted at in Charles Siegel's answer).  This is an important concept in classical projective geometry.  (Concretely, the equation for a line has the form\na x + b y + c z = 0, where a,b, and c are some parameters, not all zero, and x,y,z are homogeneous coords. for the points in the proj. plane.  The set of all such lines can thus\nbe thought of as the set of all (a,b,c) not all zero; but note that simultaneously multiplying a, b, and c by a non-zero scalar doesn't change the solution set, i.e. doesn't change the line, so the line should really be thought of as corresponding to the homogeneous coordinates (a:b:c); thus the set of all lines is again a projective plane.)</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T02:23:49.593"	""	""	""	"2"	"2"	"221"	""	"2010-07-28T02:23:49.593"	""	"898"	""	""	""	""	"892"	""
"<p>In my opinion, the most natural way to view complex number is as a class of maps from the plane to itself. Specifically, lets define $(R, \\theta)$ to be the map which multiplies every point in the plane by the number $R$, and then rotates it by the angle $\\theta$. We may call these maps ""dilations with rotations.""</p>\n\n<p>Such maps can be added and composed (multiplied) in the obvious way, and its not hard to work out that the sum and product of two such mappings is another dilation with rotation.</p>\n\n<p>We can also identify the real number $x$ with the map $(x,0)$, i.e. the map which multiplies every point in the plane by $x$.  Then we see that these maps have the magical property that $-1$ has a square root! Namely, if $P$ is the mapping $(1,\\pi/2)$ (i.e. rotate every point by angle $\\pi/2$), then applying $P$ twice is the same as multiplying every number by $-1$, i.e. $P^2=-1$! </p>\n\n<p>As should be obvious by now, these maps are just complex numbers in disguise. </p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, they are \nsingularly useful for solving polynomial equations. Indeed, the real number $x'$ is a root of the polynomial equations $a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_n =0$ if and only if the mapping $(x',0)$ satisfies the same equation. So viewing polynomial equations over the set of these mappings loses no solutions, while at the same time giving us additional freedom to do operations such as taking the square roots of negative numbers. </p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T02:30:18.093"	"3"	""	""	"27"	"2"	"317"	""	"2010-07-28T02:30:18.093"	""	"899"	""	""	""	"2011-04-15T20:45:29.080"	"154"	""

"<p>There is an extremely beautiful Lie-theoretic approach to separation of variables,\ne.g. see Willard Miller's <a href=""http://www.ima.umn.edu/~miller/separationofvariables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">book [1]</a>.

It is an\n  introduction intended for anyone with\n  experience in  partial differential\n  equations, special functions, or Lie\n  group theory, such  as group\n  theorists, applied mathematicians,\n  theoretical physicists and  chemists,\n  and electrical engineers. We will\n  exhibit some modem group-theoretic \n  twists in the ancient method of\n  separation of variables that can be \n  used to provide a foundation for much\n  of special function theory. In \n  particular, we will show explicitly\n  that all special functions that arise \n  via separation of variables in the\n  equations of mathematical physics can \n  be studied using group theory. These\n  include the functions of Lam6, Ince, \n  Mathieu, and others, as well as those\n  of hypergeometric type. </p>\n  \n  <p>This is a very critical time in the\n  kistory of group-theoretic methods in \n  special Iunction theory. The basic\n  relations between Lie groups, special \n  functions, and the method of\n  separation of variables have recently\n  been  clarified. One can now construct\n  a group-theoretic machine that, when \n  applied to a given differential\n  equation of mathematical physms,\n  describes  in a rational manner the\n  possible coordinate systems in which\n  the equation  admits solutions via\n  separation of variables and the\n  various expansion  theorems relating\n  the separable (special function)\n  solutions in distinct  coordinate\n  systems. Indeed for themost important\n  linear equations, the  separated\n  solutions are characterized as common\n  eigenfunctions of sets of \n  second-order commuting elements in the\n  umversal enveloping algebra of  the\n  Lie symmetry algebra corresponding to\n  the equation.

"<p>Alright, I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding this correctly. You say that p can be located on the right or top line and that p2 can be located on the bottom or left line. Do you mean the rectangle can be rotated? If that's the case, the question should say that p can be on the right or bottom line of the rectangle. Also, are you looking for two separate answers or one that works both when p2 is on the bottom and on the left?</p>\n\n<p>If you do mean that the rectangle can be rotated, and want two different answers, it's pretty simple. First I'll deal with when p2 is on the bottom and p is on the right.</p>\n\n<p>Since p2 is on the bottom line we know the y-coordinate is h, according to the diagram. We also know that p is (0,y). Because of the 45 degree angle, we know that the distance between p's y-coordinate and the lower right corner is the same as the distance between the lower right corner and p2's x-coordinate, which in this case is p2's x-coordinate. Therefore, the coordinates of p2 are (h-y, h).</p>\n\n<p>If p2 is on the left and p is on the bottom, it's very similar. Since p2 is on the left, it's x-coordinate is h. Because p is on the x-axis, it's (x,0).

Therefore the coordinates of p2 are (h,h-x).</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully I understood your intentions correctly.

"<p>I think you were being a little too hard on Isaac.  The truth is that the real numbers are a sophisticated mathematical construction and that any explanation of what they ""are"" which pretends otherwise is a convenient fiction.  Mathematicians need these kind of sophisticated constructions because they are what is required for rigorous proofs.  Before people explicitly constructed the real numbers and used them to define and prove things about other concepts, it was never totally clear what was true or what was false, and everybody was very confused.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Cantor proved that the number of points in the plane is the same as the number of  points on a line.  Many people thought that this was impossible before he did it; they had an intuition that you couldn't possibly ""fit"" the plane into the line.  More generally, people were pretty sure you couldn't fit $\\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\\mathbb{R}^m$ if $n$ was greater than $m$.  It wasn't until quite a bit later that mathematicians formalized and proved a rigorous mathematical statement which justified this intuition called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariance_of_domain"">invariance of domain</a>, which says you can't do this in a <em>continuous</em> way.  One of the many mathematical constructions you need to even state this theorem is the construction of the real numbers.  (Another is a formal definition of what ""continuous"" means, but one thing at a time.)</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the real numbers?  They are a formal way to fill ""holes"" in the rational numbers, which is necessary for all sorts of things.  The most basic thing they are necessary for is doing geometry.  You probably know that the square root of 2 is irrational.  What this means is that it is impossible to think about the diagonal of a square as being the same kind of object as the sides of a square while only using rational numbers.  But you can rotate a diagonal, and it looks just like the side of a square, only a bit longer.  So you'd like a number system in which you can sensibly talk about any number you can construct geometrically.  You'd also like to be able to talk about rotation!  You can't do that with just rational numbers, either.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you fill in enough holes to do geometry?  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut"">Dedekind</a> came up with a very clever way to do this.  It starts by observing that a rational number $q$ is completely determined by the set of rational numbers greater than it and the set of rational numbers less than it.  For example, 1/2 is completely determined by the fact that it's always between 1/2 + 1/n and 1/2 - 1/n.  (For the initiated, this is a special case of the Yoneda lemma.)  But there are ""numbers,"" such as the square root of 2, which aren't rational, and yet have the property that we can always tell what rational numbers are greater than it and what rational numbers are less than it.  For the square root of 2, these are precisely the fractions p/q such that 2q^2 &lt; p^2 and such that 2q^2 > p^2, respectively.  Dedekind's brilliant idea was the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Define</em> a real number to be a partition of the rational numbers!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Dedekind's construction, the square root of 2 quite literally <em>is</em> the set of rational numbers that are greater than it, and the set of rational numbers that are less than it. You can define all the usual arithmetic operations on these ""numbers,"" called Dedekind cuts, and prove all the wonderful theorems you'll find in a standard book on real analysis.  In particular, the property that guarantees that all the holes are filled is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Completeness"">completeness</a>.   </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Figured I might as well add something about the complex numbers.  The story here is beautiful, and if you're really interested you should check out Tristan Needham's <a href=""http://usf.usfca.edu/vca//"">Visual Complex Analysis</a>.  Some people say that the point of the complex numbers is to let you solve polynomials, but this is really selling them short.  The complex numbers are an inherently <em>geometric</em> construction, and should be understood as such.  Their geometry and topology just happens to be responsible for the fact that you can solve polynomials with them, but it's also responsible for much more.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quick sketch.  Now that you've got the real numbers on your hands, you can rigorously talk about plane geometry.  In plane geometry, an important notion is that of <em>similarity</em>.  Informally, two figures are similar if they have the same shape.  More formally, two figures are similar if you can rotate, translate, and scale one figure so that it matches up with the other.  So similarity is all about a certain collection of transformations of the points in the plane.  It was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program"">Klein</a> who first realized that the important features of different flavors of ""geometry"" are captured in what kind of transformations are allowed.  So to do geometry the modern way we should focus our attention on these transformations, which form a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory"">group</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To make this easier, let's ignore the translations for now.  We'll pick an origin for our plane, and we'll only allow rotations and scalings about this origin.  Rotations and scalings have the property that they are both linear transformations; this means that if you know what the transformation does to two points $u, v$, you also know what it does to the vector sum $u + v$.  In particular, a linear transformation is determined by what it does to the point $(1, 0)$ and to the point $(0, 1)$.  </p>\n\n<p>However, rotations and scalings satisfy an extra property: they are, in fact, determined by what they do to the point $(1, 0)$.  This is because $(0, 1)$ can be obtained from $(1, 0)$ by a rotation by 90 degrees, and rotations and scalings <em>commute</em> with each other: if you rotate x degrees then y degrees, that's the same as rotating y degrees then x degrees, which is the same as rotating x+y degrees.  Similarly, if you rotate x degrees then scale by 2, that's the same as scaling by 2, then rotating x degrees.  So if you know what a rotation-and-scaling does to $(1, 0)$, you just rotate that vector by 90 degrees, and you know what it did to $(0, 1)$.</p>\n\n<p>So to every rotation-and-scaling, we can assign two real numbers: the coordinates of the image of the point $(1, 0)$.  In general, a rotation by $\\theta$ angles followed by a scaling by $r$ sends $(1, 0)$ to $(r \\cos \\theta, r \\sin \\theta)$.  A different transformation, say a rotation by $\\phi$ angles followed by a scaling by $s$, sends $(1, 0)$ to $(s \\cos \\phi, s \\sin \\phi)$.  And their <em>composition</em> sends $(1, 0)$ to $(rs \\cos (\\theta + \\phi), rs \\sin (\\theta + \\phi))$.  In other words, composition of rotations-and-scalings defines a multiplication law on pairs of real numbers.  What is this law, exactly?  Well, by the angle addition formulas, it's</p>\n\n<p>$$(a, b) * (c, d) = (ac - bd, ad + bc).$$</p>\n\n<p>And this is precisely the rule for multiplication in the complex numbers, where $(a, b)$ corresponds to $a + bi$.  You get the rule for addition by observing that not only can you compose two rotations-and-scalings, you can also add their results. </p>\n\n<p>Together, the real numbers and the complex numbers provide a foundation for much of modern mathematics and physics.  For example, the complex numbers turn out (for reasons which are still not well understood) to be fundamental in the description of quantum mechanics.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T06:35:01.467"	"1"	""	""	"5"	"2"	"232"	""	"2010-07-28T06:04:47.113"	""	"920"	"232"	""	"2010-07-28T06:35:01.467"	""	"20"	""

Also its meaning should be relatively transparent to a literate native speaker of English: this is after all what the dictionary says that ""sequel"" means.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are two drawbacks.  First, as Mariano says, nowadays we hear ""sequel"" used most commonly for the next movie in a franchise, so its use in a math paper will inevitably make some readers think that you are referring to <strong>[TITLE OF YOUR PAPER] Part II: This Time, It's Personal</strong>, or whatever.  Second, in my opinion it is somewhat hackneyed language and an idiomatic usage that doesn't add any meaning.  If you read enough math papers you'll find that there are certain linguistic ticks that people pick up from each other (and also sometimes, from writing in other languages), e.g. beginning a sentence with ""Remark that..."" sounds a little stilted and is probably a semiconscious translation of the french phrase ""Remarquer que"" (which I would translate as ""Notice that"").  Most people agree that good mathematical writing is as stylistically unobstrusive as possible, so using phrases that make people ponder and ask questions about them on websites is, arguably, slightly too distracting.  </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it's  no big deal.  If I were a referee or even a copyeditor, I would almost certainly let the author use ""in the sequel"" if she wants.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T07:12:25.707"	"3"	""	""	"12"	"2"	"299"	""	"2010-07-28T07:12:25.707"	""	"924"	""	""	""	""	"907"	""

"<p>This is somewhere between an answer and commentary.  As others have said, the question is equivalent to showing: for any prime $p &gt; 3$, $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $p^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$.  Both of these statements are straightforward to show by just looking at the $\\varphi(3) = 2$ reduced residue classes modulo $3$ and the $\\varphi(8) = 4$ reduced residue classes modulo $8$.  But what is their significance?</p>\n\n<p>For a positive integer $n$, let $U(n) = (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{\\times}$ be the multiplicative group of units (""reduced residues"") modulo $n$.  Like any abelian group $G$, we have a squaring map</p>\n\n<p>$[2]: G \\rightarrow G$, $g \\mapsto g^2$,</p>\n\n<p>the image of which is the set of squares in $G$.  So, the question is equivalent to: for $n = 3$ and also $n = 8$, the subgroup of squares in $U(n)$ is the trivial group.  </p>\n\n<p>The group $U(3) = \\{ \\pm 1\\}$ has order $2$; since $(-1)^2 = 1$, the fact that the subgroup of squares is equal to $1$ is pretty clear.  But more generally, for any odd prime $p$, the squaring map $[2]$ on $U(p)$ is two-to-one onto its image -- an element of a field has no more than two square roots -- so that precisely half of the elements of $U(p)$ are squares.  It turns out that when $p = 3$, half of $p-1$ is $1$, but of course this is somewhat unusual: it doesn't happen for any other odd prime $p$.</p>\n\n<p>The group $U(8) = \\{1,3,5,7\\}$ has order $4$.  By analogy to the case of $U(p)$, one might expect the squaring map to be two-to-one onto its image so that exactly half of the elements are squares.  But that is not what is happening here: indeed </p>\n\n<p>$1^2 \\equiv 3^2 \\equiv 5^2 \\equiv 7^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$,</p>\n\n<p>so the subgroup of squares is again trivial.  What's different?  Since $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field, it is legal for a given element to have more than two square roots, but a more insightful answer comes from the structure of the groups $U(n)$.  For any odd prime $p$, the group $U(p)$ is <em>cyclic</em> of order $p-1$ (""existence of primitive roots"").  It is easy to see that in any cyclic group of even order, exactly half of the elements are squares.  So $U(8)$ must not be cyclic, so it must be the other abelian group of order $4$, i.e., isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group $C_2 \\times C_2$.  </p>\n\n<p>More generally, if $p$ is an odd prime number and $a$ is a positive integer, then \n$U(p^a)$ is cyclic of order $p^{a-1}(p-1)$ hence isomorphic to $C_{p^{a-1}} \\times C_{p-1}$, whereas for any $a \\geq 2$, the group $U(2^a)$ is isomorphic to $C_{2^{a-2}} \\times C_2$.  This is one of the first signs in number theory ""there is something odd about the prime $2$"".  </p>\n\n<p><b>Added</b>: Note that the above considerations allow us to answer the more general question: ""What is the largest positive integer $N$ such that for all primes $p$ with $\\operatorname{gcd}(p,N) = 1$, $N$ divides $(p^2-1)$?""

"<p>Homotopy theory is useful in quantum mechanics when (for instance) talking about manifolds of Hamiltonians.  You might have a collection of Hamiltonians that depend continuously on some parameters $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ such that the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian is periodic in some subset of the parameters $p_{r_1}, p_{r_2}, \\ldots, p_{r_m}$.  From this, the fundamental group of the manifold of Hamiltonians can be computed, which has some physical ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>A concrete example of this would be the Hamiltonian that describes the quantum hall effect.  The quantum hall effect is the phenomena that the resistance in a 2-dimensional substrate exposed to a perpendicular electric field at close to zero temperature is quantized.  In condensed matter physics there is a notion called quasimomentum that can be thought of as being related to momentum but is a bit different.  We need something different from the classical definition of momentum because the classical definition depends on translation invariance, and in a crystal there is only discrete translation invariance.  In the quantum hall effect, we have two quasimomenta: $k_x, and k_y$, corresponding to quasimomentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions.  The Hamiltonian is periodic in both of these parameters, leading to a fundamental group of the manifold of Hamiltonians of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, i.e. the fundamental group of the torus $T^2$.</p>\n\n<p>There's a lot more to the topic than this.

"<p>The correct answer has already been given by Akhil Mathew in the comments above.</p>\n\n<p>The topic belongs to the field of complexity theory in computer science. In complexity theory, there exists an intriguing concept for the problem of deciding whether a given word belongs to a given formal language or not: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_proof_system"" rel=""nofollow"">interactive proof systems</a>. These systems model the interaction between resource-limited verifier (say, you or me) and an almighty prover (say, your much, much smarter older sister). The goal of the interaction is that the prover convinces the verifier from the fact that the given word is or is not an element of the language such that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>almost surely, the verfier can only be convinced from the true answer and</li>\n<li>the verifier can only be fooled to believe the opposite within a very small margin of error.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a large number of theoretical results with respect to these interactive systems. These resuts include the follwoing two statements (given informally):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>everything that can be proven by such an interactive protocoll can also be proven using an interactive protocoll that convinces the verifier (within small margin of error) but it does not reveal <em>any</em> information about the proof itself. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">Zero-Knowledge-Proof</a>, ""Everything provable is provable in zero-knowledge"" by Ben-Or et al, 1988)</li>\n<li>every proof can be rewritten such that inspection of just a constant number of bits from this proof convinces the verifier within only a small margin of error (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">PCP-Theorem</a>, ""Proof verification and the hardness of approximation problems"" by Arora et al, 1992, and a number of other papers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of these concepts and results are highly non-trivial and beyond the scope of this forum.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, in the quote above Scott Aaronson is just using some everyday's problem to illustrate these concepts. To use these results formally, would have to convert the task of ""proving the Riemann Hypothesis"" to a decision problem of formal languages, as is standard in complexity theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>EDIT: There is in fact a small modification in the model between both results stated above which I omitted. First, the interaction between one prover and the verifier can be generalized to multiple provers and a verifier. Next, there is a result that finds that the case of multiple provers can be equivalently reformulated as follows: The provers are removed from the protocol, rather there is a single (possibly very long) string which acts as a written proof for the word problem. Interaction is now looking at an arbitrarily chosen bit of this proof, and the verifier may choose the location of these bits randomly. This is called a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistically_checkable_proof"" rel=""nofollow"">Probabilistic Checkable Proof</a> (hence, PCP). So ,in this scenario, the ""written proof"" of the Riemann Hypothesis would be interpreted as the proof string.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T12:52:06.407"	"2"	""	""	"11"	"2"	"347"	""	"2010-07-28T12:26:56.757"	""	"950"	"347"	""	"2010-07-28T12:52:06.407"	""	"944"	""

"<p>Kevin Lin's answer regarding the meaning of closed points is quite reasonable, especialy in the case when the scheme in question underlies a classical variety.  I want to add some additional remarks and examples for thinking about more general schemes.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some tautological remarks: recall that a point x in a scheme X is called a specialization of y if x lies in the Zariski closure of y (and y is called a generalization of x).  So tautologically, a closed points is one that cannot be specialized any further (just as a generic point cannot be generalized any further).  What does specialization really mean:\nring theoretically, it means taking the image under a homomorphism; so if p and q are prime\nideals of a ring A, then q is a specialization of p in Spec A if and only if q contains p, i.e. if A/p surjects onto A/q.  It is perhaps best to think of an example: say A is C[x,y],\np is the prime ideal gen'd by (x-1) and q is the prime (actually maximal ideal) gen'd by (x-1,y).  Then in A/p, we have ""specialized"" the value of x to equal 1 (because we have \ndeclared x-1 = 0) but y is still a free variable.  When we pass to the further quotient A/q, we have specialized both x and y: x is specialized to 1 and y is specialized to 0.   At this point, we can't specialize any more; technically, this is because q is a maximal ideal of A,\nso a closed point of Spec A; intuitively, it is because both x and y have now both been ""specialized"" to actual numbers, and so we can't specialize any further.</p>\n\n<p>But suppose now we set B = Z[x,y], and take p and q to be the same, i.e. gen'd by x-1 and by\n(x-1,y) respectively.  Then q is <em>not</em> maximal; there is more capacity for specialization.\nHow is this?  Well, x and y are now taking values in Z (rather than the field C) and so we can also reduce both x and y modulo some prime, say 5; this gives a prime ideal r = (x-1,y,5) in B containing q.  Now r <em>is</em> maximal, and so we are done specializing.  </p>\n\n<p>So if you have a scheme that is finite type over Z, the closed points will correspond to \n""actual points"", in Kevin's terminology, but defined over finite fields.  The points of the scheme whose coordinates are integers, say, will <em>not</em> be closed.  One has the choice of thinking them of them as ""actual points"" which nevertheless can be specialized further by reducing modulo primes, or as subvarieties rather than ""actual points"", by identifying them\nwith their Zariski closures (for a picture of this, see the drawing of Mumford that Kevin links to).</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T19:56:54.470"	"0"	""	""	"6"	"2"	"221"	""	"2010-07-28T16:30:13.550"	""	"984"	"221"	""	"2010-07-28T19:56:54.470"	""	"942"	""

"<p>My answer from the MO thread:</p>\n\n<p>A matrix is just a list of numbers, and you're allowed to add and multiply matrices by combining those numbers in a certain way. When you talk about matrices, you're allowed to talk about things like the entry in the 3rd row and 4th column, and so forth. In this setting, matrices are useful for representing things like transition probabilities in a Markov chain, where each entry indicates the probability of transitioning from one state to another. You can do lots of interesting numerical things with matrices, and these interesting numerical things are very important because matrices show up a lot in engineering and the sciences.</p>\n\n<p>In linear algebra, however, you instead talk about linear transformations, which are <strong>not</strong> (I cannot emphasize this enough) a list of numbers, although sometimes it is convenient to use a particular matrix to write down a linear transformation. The difference between a linear transformation and a matrix is not easy to grasp the first time you see it, and most people would be fine with conflating the two points of view. However, when you're given a linear transformation, you're not allowed to ask for things like the entry in its 3rd row and 4th column because questions like these depend on a choice of basis. Instead, you're only allowed to ask for things that don't depend on the basis, such as the rank, the trace, the determinant, or the set of eigenvalues. This point of view may seem unnecessarily restrictive, but it is fundamental to a deeper understanding of pure mathematics.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T18:17:43.873"	"2"	""	""	"6"	"2"	"232"	""	"2010-07-28T18:17:43.873"	""	"1008"	""	""	""	""	"996"	""

"<p>A more complicated answer (yet it's going to be imprecise, because I haven't touched this in 15 years...) is the following.</p>\n\n<p>In a 3-dimentional space (for example) you can represent a vector <strong>v</strong> by its end point coordinates, x, y, z, in a very simple way. You choose three vectors which are of unit length and orthogonal with each other (a base), say <strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong> and <strong>k</strong>, and calculate the coordinates as such:</p>\n\n<p>x = <strong>v</strong> \u2219 <strong>i</strong></p>\n\n<p>y = <strong>v</strong> \u2219 <strong>j</strong></p>\n\n<p>z = <strong>v</strong> \u2219 <strong>k</strong></p>\n\n<p>In multidimentional space, the equations still hold. In a discrete infinite space, the coordinates and the base vectors become a sequence. The dot product becomes an infinite sum. </p>\n\n<p>In a continuous infinite space (like the space of good functions) the coordinates and the bases become functions and the dot product an infinite integral.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the Fourier transform is exactly this kind of operation (based on a set of base functions which are basically a set of sines and cosines). In other words, it is a different representation of the same function in relation to a particular set of base functions.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, for example, functions of time, represented against functions of time and space (in other words integrated over time multiplied by functions of space and time), become functions of space, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps!</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T19:40:11.203"	"6"	""	""	"-2"	"2"	"272"	""	"2010-07-28T19:40:11.203"	""	"1040"	""	""	""	"2011-04-14T11:45:07.350"	"1002"	""

"<p>Let me partially steal from the accepted answer on MO, and illustrate it with examples I understand:<br>\n<em>The Fourier transform is a different representation that makes convolutions easy.</em><br>\nOr, to quote directly from there: ""the Fourier transform is a unitary change of basis for functions (or distributions) that diagonalizes all convolution operators."" This often involves expressing an arbitrary function as a superposition of ""symmetric"" functions of some sort, say functions of the form e<sup>itx</sup> \u2014\xa0in the common signal-processing applications, an arbitrary ""signal"" is decomposed as a superposition of ""waves"" (or ""frequencies"").</p>\n\n<h3>Example 1: Polynomial multiplication</h3>\n\n<p>This is the use of the discrete Fourier transform I'm most familiar with. Suppose you want to multiply two polynomials of degree n, given by their coefficients (a<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, a<sub>n</sub>) and (b<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, b<sub>n</sub>). In their product, the coefficient of x<sup>k</sup> is c<sub>k</sub> = &sum;a<sub>i</sub>b<sub>k-i</sub>. This is a convolution, and doing it naively would take O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, suppose we represent the polynomials by their <em>values</em> at 2n points. Then the value of the product polynomial (the one we want) at any point is simply the product of the values of our original two polynomials. Thus we have reduced convolution to pointwise multiplication. The Fourier transform and its inverse correspond to polynomial evaluation and interpolation respectively, for certain well-chosen points (roots of unity). The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a way of doing both of these in O(n log n) time.</p>\n\n<h3>Example 2: Convolution of probability distributions</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose we have two independent (continuous) random variables X and Y, with probability densities f and g respectively. In other words, P(X \u2264 x) = \u222b<sup>x</sup><sub>-\u221e</sub> f(t)dt and P(Y \u2264 y) = \u222b<sup>y</sup><sub>-\u221e</sub> f(t)dt. We often want the distribution of their sum X+Y, and this is given by a convolution: P(X+Y \u2264 z) = \u222bf(t)g(z-t)dt. This integration may be hard. </p>\n\n<p>But instead of representing the random variables by their densities, we can also represent them by their <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_%28probability_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">characteristic functions</a> &phi;<sub>X</sub>(t) =  E[e<sup>itX</sup>] and &phi;<sub>Y</sub>(t) = E[e<sup>itY</sup>]. Then the characteristic function of X+Y is just:<br>\n&phi;<sub>X+Y</sub>(t) = E[e<sup>it(X+Y)</sup>] = &phi;<sub>X</sub>(t)&phi;<sub>Y</sub>(t) since they're independent. The characteristic function is the continuous Fourier transform of the density function; it is a change of representation in which convolution becomes pointwise multiplication.</p>\n\n<p>To quote again the answer on MO, many transformations we want to study (translation, differentiation, integration, \u2026) are actually convolutions, so the Fourier transform helps in a wide number of instances. </p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T20:54:58.573"	""	""	""	"10"	"2"	"205"	""	"2010-07-28T20:54:58.573"	""	"1054"	""	""	""	"2011-04-14T11:45:07.350"	"1002"	""

"<p>The Lie derivative is a derivative of a vector <em>field</em> V along another vector <em>field</em> W.  It is defined at a point p as follows: flow the point p along W for some time t and look at the value of V at this point.  Then push this forward along the flow of W to a vector at p.  Subtract V_p from this, divide by t, and take the limit as t->0.  So this is a measure of how V changes as it gets pushed around by the flow of W.</p>\n\n<p>The covariant derivative is a derivative of a vector <em>field</em> V along a vector W.  Unlike the Lie derivative, this does not come for free: we need a connection, which is a way of identifying tangent spaces.  The reason we need this extra data is because if we wanted to take the directional derivative of V along the vector W how we do in Euclidean space, we would be taking something like V_(p+tW) - V_p, which is the difference of vectors living in different tangent spaces.  If we have a metric, then we can impose reasonable conditions that give us a unique connection (the Levi-Civita connection). </p>\n\n<p>I have no idea what a contravariant derivative is.

"<p>I think your question here shows that, while you have been using these symbols, you haven't really been given a proper motivation for where they came from.<br>\nLet's go back and consider how we came up with the idea of an integral. In a typical class, you will see a lot of pictures like this:<br>\n<img src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Integral_approximations.svg/420px-Integral_approximations.svg.png"" alt=""alt text""><br>\nWe find the area under the curve by summing up the area of all these little rectangles. If we wanted to write an expression for the area, it would look like:<br>\n<img src=""http://mathurl.com/27gla3n.png"" alt=""alt text""><br>\nThe \u03a3 means that we are computing a sum. We are adding the areas of the rectangles, which we have numbered 1 through n, to get the complete area under the curve. The area of each rectangle is given by multiplying the height by the width. The height is given by f(x<sub>i</sub>) because the base of the rectangle is at 0, and the top of the rectangle is where it meets the function f. The \u0394x represents the width of each rectangle.<br>\nWhen we find the integral, we are taking the limit of this sum as the number of rectangles goes to infinity, and each individual rectangle becomes infinitesimally tiny. You can think of the dx as the equivalent of \u0394x: it represents the infinitesimally small width of each rectangle that we added up to get the area.  </p>\n\n<p>Once you realize this, we can see why integrals only make sense when written \u222bf(x)dx. Because we are adding up the areas of rectangles that have height f(x) and width dx. If you try to interpret the expressions you wrote in this way, you will see that they do not really make sense as integrals: you are not summing up rectangles, so you are not finding an area under a curve.  </p>\n\n<p>You could, of course, define your own notation in which those expressions behave the way you expect them to, but all mathematical notation is driven based on what people find useful, and what people can agree on and easily understand. Your reuse of the integral sign and dx that people are used to seeing in a particular context will probably result in few people adopting your definition.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T23:33:30.033"	"4"	""	""	"18"	"2"	"73"	""	"2010-07-28T23:33:30.033"	""	"1075"	""	""	""	""	"1068"	""
"<p>There is another proof that the derivative of sine is cosine that doesn't use the sandwich theorem mentioned by Qiaochu and Akhil above.  Instead, one can use the definition of arcsine and the standard calculus formula for arc length in terms of an integral to show that arcsine = the integral of (1 - x^2)^(-.5).  It follows that the derivative of arcsine is (1 - x^2)^(-.5), and (by the chain rule) one can use this fact to prove that the derivative of sine is cosine.\nIn fact, I'm not sure why this proof is presented less frequently then the one via the sandwich theorem.  The unit circle definition of sine is based on arc length, and in calculus we learn a formula for arc length based on integration.  Why not connect these two concepts for a natural proof that the derivative of sine is cosine?</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-07-28T23:34:06.787"	"1"	""	""	"2"	"2"	""	""	"2010-07-28T23:34:06.787"	""	"1076"	""	""	""	""	"1048"	""

"<p>1) Why does a small number of states suffice?\nRegardless of whether the constant is 5 or 500, its still very surprising. Thankfully, it's fairly to prove if you allow the counter to be <code>{1...8}</code> instead of <code>{1...5}</code>. [This proof is by Ben-Or and Cleve.]. Start by representing the computation as a circuit, and ignore the whole wiping-clean thing.</p>\n\n<p>Define a register machine as follows: It has 3 registers <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3)</code>, each of which holds a single bit. At each step, the program performs some computation on the registers of the form <code>R_i &lt;-- R_a + x_b R_c</code> or <code>R_i &lt;-- R_a + x_b R_c + R_d</code> (where <code>x_1...x_n</code> is the input).</p>\n\n<p>Initially, set <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3) = (1,0,0)</code>. The machine should end in the state <code>R_3 + f R_1</code>. We'll simulate the circuit using a register machine.</p>\n\n<p>We now proceed by induction on the depth of the circuit. If the circuit has depth 0, then we just copy the appropriate bit: <code>R_3 &lt;-- R_3 + x_i R_1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For the induction, we have 3 cases, according to whether the final gate is NOT, AND, or OR.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose that the circuit is <code>NOT(f)</code>. By induction, we can compute <code>f</code>, yielding the state <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)</code>. We can therefore perform the instruction <code>R_3 &lt;-- R_3 + R_1</code> to get the desired output.</p>\n\n<p>If the circuit is <code>AND(f_1,f_2)</code>, then life is a tad more complicated. By induction, we then execute the following 4 instructions</p>\n\n<p><code>R_2 &lt;-- R_2 + f_1 R_1</code> <br>\n<code>R_3 &lt;-- R_3 + f_2 R_2</code> <br>\n<code>R_2 &lt;-- R_2 + f_1 R_1</code> <br>\n<code>R_3 &lt;-- R_3 + f_2 R_2</code></p>\n\n<p>Assuming I haven't made any typos, we are left with the state <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3+f_1f_2R_1)</code>, as desired. OR works similarly.</p>\n\n<p>QED.</p>\n\n<p>Take a moment to process what just happened. It's a slick proof that you have to read 2 or 3 times before it begins to sink in. What we've shown is that we can simulate a circuit by applying a fixed program that stores only 3 bits of information at any time.</p>\n\n<p>To convert this into Aaronson's version, we encode the three registers into the counter (that's why we needed the extra 3 spaces). The simple program uses the input and the clock to determine how far we've made it through the computation and then applies the appropriate change to the counter. </p>\n\n<p>2) But what's the deal with 5?</p>\n\n<p>To get from 8 states down to 5, you use a similar argument, but are much more careful about exactly how much information needs to be propagated between stages and how it can be encoded. A formal proof requires lots of advanced group theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Edit to answer Casebash's questions:</p>\n\n<p>1) Correct. Any computation can be expressed as a circuit composed solely of ""NOT"", binary-""AND"", and binary-""OR"" gates.</p>\n\n<p>2) The notation <code>f R_1</code> means (boolean) multiplication.</p>\n\n<p>3) The program for computing <code>f</code> should take input <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3)</code> to <code>(R_1,R_2,R_3 + f R_1)</code>. We insist that the first two registers are unchanged since we use those as temporary storage in the induction. For example, when computing <code>AND</code>, we compute the first branch and store the result in <code>R_2</code> while computing the second branch.</p>\n\n<p>4) The single bit of output is the final value of <code>R_3</code>. Since we started with <code>(1,0,0)</code>, we end with <code>(1,0,f)</code>.</p>\n"	""	""	"2010-12-06T23:24:29.673"	"3"	""	""	"6"	"2"	"275"	""	"2010-07-28T23:44:41.060"	""	"1078"	"275"	""	"2010-12-06T23:24:29.673"	""	"946"	""
