But there's a problem, we don't know how to count the bushels or the sheep!  So what do we do?\r\n\r\nWe form a ""bijection"" between the two sets.  That's just fancy language for saying you pair things up by putting one bushel next to each of the sheep.  When we're done we swap.  We've just proved that the number of sheep is the same as the number of bushels without actually counting.\r\n\r\nWe can try doing the same thing with infinite sets.  So suppose you have the set of positive numbers and I have the set of rational numbers and you want to trade me one positive number for each of my rationals.  Can you do so in a way that gets all of my rational numbers?\r\n\r\nPerhaps surprisingly the answer is yes!  You make the rational numbers into a big square grid with the numerator and denominators as the two coordinates.  Then you start placing your ""bushels"" along diagonals of increasing size, [see wikipedia][1].\r\n\r\nThis says that the rational numbers are ""countable"" that is you can find a clever way to count them off in the above fashion.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fact is that for the real numbers there's *no way at all* to count them off in this way.

"2010-07-20T19:23:17.570"	"2"	"35"	"The basic concept is thus:\r\n\r\n - A 'countable' infinity is one where you can give each item in the set an integer and 'count' them (even though there are an infinite number of them)\r\n - An 'uncountable' infinity defies this. You cannot assign an integer to each item in the set because you will miss items.\r\n\r\nThe key to seeing this is using the 'diagonal slash' argument as originally put forward by Cantor. With a countable infinity, you can create a list of all the items in the set and assign each one a different natural number. This can be done with the naturals (obviously) and the complete range of integers (including negative numbers) and even the rational numbers (so including fractions). It cannot be done with the reals due to the diagonal slash argument:\r\n\r\n 1. Create your list of all real numbers and assign each one an integer\r\n 2. Create a real number with the rule that the first digit after the decimal point is different from the first digit of your first number, the second digit is different from the second digit of your second number, and so on for all digits\r\n 3. Try and place this number in your list of all numbers... it can't be the first number, or the second or the third... and so on down the list. \r\n 4. Reductio Ad Absurdium, your number does not exist in your countable list of all real numbers and must be added on to create a new list. The same process can then be done again to show the list still isn't complete.\r\n\r\nThis shows a difference between two obviously infinite sets and leads to the somewhat scary conclusion that there are (at least) 2 different forms of infinity.\r\n\r\n"	"0c68610b-97f4-40f1-8edb-d221d502e5a8"	"13"	"30"	""	""	""

This group is always commutative!\r\n\r\nIf you forget about addition, then a ring does not become a group with respect to multiplication. The binary operation of multiplication is associative and it does have an identity 1, but some elements like 0 do not have inverses. (This structure is called a monoid.)\r\n\r\nA commutative ring is a field when all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverses. In this case, if you forget about addition and remove 0, the remaining elements do form a group under multiplication. This group is again commutative.\r\n\r\nA division ring is a (not necessarily commutative) ring in which all nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. Again, if you forget about addition and remove 0, the remaining elements do form a group under multiplication. This group is not necessarily commutative.

In 3D, it means the vector\r\n\r\n    < df/dx, df/dy, df/dz >\r\n\r\nSo, if `f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^3*z + sin(z)`, `\u2207f = < 2x, 3y^2*z, cos(z) >`\r\n\r\nThere are some neat properties about the del operator.  Here are a couple:\r\n\r\n- The most famous is that `\u2207f` yields the **gradient** of `f`.  That is, at any point `(x,y,z)`, `\u2207f(x,y,z)` is the vector pointing in the direction where it is **most increasing**.  The magnitude of it is the magnitude of the increase.\r\n    \r\n    This is easier to understand with, say, a 2D `f(x,y)`.  If `f(x,y)` represents the height of a point at `(x,y)`, then `\u2207f(x,y)` represents the steepest incline from that point.  Or rather, if you placed a ball on that point, it would *start rolling in the opposite direction of the gradient vector*.\r\n\r\n- Normally, for multi-dimensional functions, it is easiest to find the derivative along an axis (x, y, z, etc.).  With \u2207, you can find the derivative along any arbitrary direction by using \u2207f * u, where * is the dot product and u is the unit vector along the direction you are calculating.\r\n\r\n- \u2207 is also used to calculate divergence (amount that vectors are ""spreading out"") and curl (amount that vectors are ""curling up"") of a vector field.\r\n\r\n    Divergence is \u2207 * f (dot product), and curl is \u2207 x f (cross product)\r\n    \r\n    They aren't truly ""products"" in the sense.  Rather, when you are calculating divergence and curl and you must do `d/dx * (something)`, you are actually doing `d/dx (something)` or `d(something)/dx`.\r\n\r\n    This is why it's called an ""operator""."

I've used all of these on occasion.\r\n\r\n**A way to solve polynomials**\r\n\r\nWe came up with equations like `x - 5 = 0, what is x?`, and the naturals solved them (easily). Then we asked, ""wait, what about `x + 5 = 0`?"" So we invented negative numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about `2x = 1`?"" So we invented rational numbers. Then we asked ""wait, what about `x^2 = 2`?"" so we invented irrational numbers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we asked, ""wait, what about `x^2 = -1`?"" This is the only question that was left, so we decided to invent the ""imaginary"" numbers to solve it. All the other numbers, at some point, didn't exist and didn't seem ""real"", but now they're fine. Now that we have imaginary numbers, we can solve every polynomial, so it makes sense that that's the last place to stop.\r\n\r\n**Pairs of numbers**\r\n\r\nThis explanation goes the route of redefinition. Tell the listener to forget everything he knows about imaginary numbers. You're defining a new number system, only now there are always pairs of numbers. Why? For fun. Then go through explaining how addition/multiplication work. Try and find a good ""realistic"" use of pairs of numbers (many exist).\r\n\r\nThen, show that in this system,  `(0,1) * (0,1) = (-1,0)`, in other words, we've defined a new system, under which it makes sense to say that `sqrt(-1) = i`, when `i=(0,1)`. And that's really all there is to imaginary numbers: a definition of a new number system, which makes sense to use in most places. And under that system, there **is** an answer to `sqrt(-1)`.\r\n\r\n**The historical explanation**\r\n\r\nExplain the history of the imaginary numbers. Showing that mathematicians *also* fought against them for a long time helps people understand the mathematical process, i.e., that it's all definitions in the end.\r\n\r\nI'm a little rusty, but I think there were certain equations that kept having parts of them which used `sqrt(-1)`, and the mathematicians kept  throwing out the equations since there is no such thing.\r\n\r\nThen, one mathematician decided to just ""roll with it"", and kept working, and found out that all those square roots cancelled each other out.\r\n\r\nAmazingly, the answer that was left was the **correct answer** (he was working on finding roots of polynomials, I think). Which lead him to think that there *was* a valid reason to use `sqrt(-1)`, even if it took a long time to understand it."	"0472ef57-e710-42ac-9f6e-e90de97598bf"	"168"	"326"	""	""	""

When you first hear this, it sounds crazy. 0 squared is 0; a positive times a positive is positive and a negative times a negative is positive too. So there doesn't actually appear to be any number that we can square to get -1.\r\n\r\nA mathematician would collectively term 0, negative numbers and positive numbers as the real numbers. They would also define the term complex numbers as a group of numbers that includes these real numbers. So while we have shown that no real number can square to get -1, we haven't even defined complex numbers at this point, so we can't rule out that one might have this property.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it makes sense to ask what does a mathematician mean by a number? It certainly isn't what most people associate it with - as an abstract representation some kind of real world quantity. We need to understand that it isn't uncommon for one word to have different meanings for different groups of people - after all words mean whatever we make them mean. Most people only need to real world quantities, so they find it convenient to call those numbers. On the other hand, mathematicians explore a variety of different number systems. Indeed some, such as complex numbers, are useful for solving problems that are actually about real numbers.\r\n\r\nSo mathematicians define i as a number that obeys most of the normal algebraic laws.

They are are also space efficient (three numbers). However, it is more difficult to linear interpolate values. Consider the case where you want to interpolate between 359 and 0 degrees. Linearly interpolating would cause a large rotation, even though the two orientations are almost the same. Writing shortest path interpolation, is easy for one axis, but non-trivial when considering the three Euler angles(for instance the shortest route between (240, 57, 145) and (35, -233, -270) is not immediately clear).\r\n\r\nRotation matrices specify a new frame of reference using three normalized and orthogonal vectors (Right, Up, Out, which when multiplied become the new x, y, z). Rotation matrices are useful for operations like strafing (side ways movement), which only requires translating along the Right vector of the camera's rotation matrix. However, there is no clear method of interpolating between them. The are also expensive to normalize which is necessary to prevent scaling from being introduced.\r\n\r\nAxis angle, as the name suggests, are a way of specifying a rotation axis and angle to rotate around that axis. You can think of Euler angles, as three axis angle rotations, where the axises are the x, y, z axis respectively. Linearly interpolating the angle in a axis angle is pretty straight forward (if you remember to take the shortest path), however linearly interpolating between different axises is not. \r\n\r\nQuaternions are a way of specifying a rotation through a axis and the cosine of half the angle. They main advantage is I can pick any two quaternions and smoothly interpolate between them.\r\n\r\nRotors are another way to perform rotations. Rotors are basically quaternions, but instead of thinking of them as 4D complex numbers, rotors are thought of as real 3D multivectors. This makes their visualization much more understandable (compared to quaternions), but requires fluency in geometric algebra to grasp their significance.\r\n\r\nOkay with that as the background I can discuss a real world example. \r\n\r\n> Say you are writing a computer game\r\n> where the characters are animated in\r\n> 3ds Max.

It can also be proved by simply playing with trigonometric polynomials (i.e., polynomials in $e^{2\\pi i k x}$ for $k$ an integer) and using the fact they are dense in the space of all continuous functions with period 1.  In particular, one shows that if $f(x)$ is a continuous function with period 1, then for any $t$,  $\\int_0^1 f(x) dx = \\lim \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(t+i \\xi)$. One shows this by checking this (directly) for trigonometric polynomials via the geometric series.  This is a very elementary and nice proof.\r\n\r\nThe general form of Weyl's theorem states that if $p$ is a monic integer-valued polynomial, then the sequence $\\{p(n \\xi)\\}$ for $\\xi$ irrational is uniformly distributed modulo 1.

If it were me, I'd take discrete math and operations research over the other two in (3), because they'll be useful for economics and because those subjects are the most different from linear algebra and real analysis. The group theory wouldn't, as far as I know, be tremendously applicable to economics except as it relates to analysis, and you'll get a sense of an algebraic way of thinking through linear. Numerical and symbolic math, if it includes numerical analysis, would be very relevant.\r\n\r\nA main criterion I am using here is that you'll want to learn more math as you go on in econ, and so the most important thing, for your ability to learn various things on your own later and for developing an appreciation for different kinds of math, is to take courses that cover many different kinds of mathematical thinking (including that which is more directly relevant to econ and other applied areas)."

First we determine whether we are on a line - this is simple using substitution and range checking. For the range checking, suppose we have a segment (x1,y1), (x2,y2). We check that x1<=x0<=x2 or x2<=x0<=x1 and do the same for y.\r\n\r\nNow, if we aren't on a line, we draw a ray from the point and count how many lines you intersect. If the line doesn't intersect a corner or contain a non-degenerate segment of an edge, then an odd number of intersections should mean you are inside and an even number mean outside.\r\n\r\nIf we intersect with a corner, it is more difficult. Clearly, the ray could leave with it only intersecting a corner, but it could also pass through the corner without entering the polygon. One solution is to pick the ray so that it doesn't intersect a corner or go along a line - this should always be possible. We can also use cross product to determine whether we are crossing the lines at their corner or not (just check if the adjacent vertices are on the same side of the line or not).\r\n\r\n"	"e9d2ed3d-b3a5-4453-86e4-a208bc9beaf7"	"238"	"501"	"added 523 characters in body; added 9 characters in body"	""	""

This definite integral is ln(n), so you should expect 1+1/2+1/3+...+1/n to grow like ln(n).\r\n\r\nAlthough this argument can be made rigorous, it's still unsatisfying because it depends on the fact that the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is probably harder than the original question.

It is 'high level complete system' versus 'low level core with specialist toolboxes'. Mathematica can do all the numeric math and matrix work that Matlab can do, as fast and as accurately. Matlab is almost strictly a subset of the functionality of Mathematica.\r\n\r\nMuch of the wider functionality for Matlab is sold as additional toolboxes. e.g. Matlab has toolboxes for curve fitting, statistics, optimization, symbolic math, PDEs, Image acquisition etc but ALL of these areas of functionality are built in to Mathematica already. Aside from the cost and inconvenience of making you buy every function that you need separately, the Matlab design means that the core is inherently low level (since it cannot call on any of the toolbox functionality in case you have not purchased that toolbox), and many of these functions do not fit well together (e.g. no toolbox function can be used with symbolic parameters as they are all written using the numeric-only Matlab core).\r\n\r\nMatlab's only comparative strength lies in some of its specialist toolboxes (e.g. control theory where it is dominant) but if you are not in that specialism, those are of no use.\r\n\r\nSome specific differences between the core systems:\r\n\r\n - Matlab is machine precision numeric only with some support for complex arithmetic - all Mathematica functions support machine precision and arbitrary precision real and complex arithmetic, exact arithmetic and symbolic computation.\r\n - Matlab basic data model is 2D (matrices) with a pointer mechanism to emulate higher dimensions - Mathematica basic data model handles any dimensionality without extra work.\r\n - Many of Mathematica's functions switch automatically between different algorithms (with a manual overide) - in Matlab you must always choose the algorithm.\r\n - Matlab requires you to manually linearize ODEs to a system of first order equations before it can solve them - Mathematica accepts any order ODE.\r\n - Matlab can do integration up to only three dimensions (with triplequad) Mathematica handles n-dimensional integration for any n.\r\n - Matlab's language is procedural only (rather like higher level FORTRAN) - Mathematica allows programming in procedural, functional, object oriented and rule based styles.\r\n - Matlab has text interface and a basic home grown IDE - Mathematica has text interface, document interface, GUI tools, and full Eclipse based IDE.\r\n\r\nSource: [helium.com][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.helium.com/items/895074-comparing-matlab-and-mathematica"	"0c63af7f-0d83-4cc2-8f54-eaf8bb1de29d"	"277"	"609"	""	""	""

From the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number):\r\n\r\n> In mathematics, there are two\r\n> conventions for the set of natural\r\n> numbers: it is either the set of\r\n> positive integers  {1, 2, 3, ...}\r\n> according to the traditional\r\n> definition; or the set of non-negative\r\n> integers {0, 1, 2, ...} according to a\r\n> definition first appearing in the\r\n> nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nSaying that, more often than not I've seen the natural numbers only representing the 'counting numbers' (i.e. excluding zero). This was the traditional historical definition, and makes more sense to me. Zero is in many ways the 'odd one out' - indeed, historically it was not discovered (described?) until some time after the natural numbers."

Just in case, I prove below that each element 1, 2, ... n-1 has a unique inverse mod n.\r\n\r\nThey use the fact that integers mod p form a group and hence that each element `x not congruent 0` has a multiplicative inverse (a number y such that `xy congruent 1 (mod n)`.\r\nWe show this as follows. Suppose `n not | x`, for n prime. From the uniqueness of prime factorisations, xn is the first product of x, after 0x, divisible by n (use prime factorisation theorem). If we look at the series kn in mod n, this cycles and must have cycle length n. Therefore, each element x, 2x,... nx must be different modulo n, including one, y, with `xy congruent 1 mod n). Furthermore, due to the cycle length being n, each only one of those elements will be an inverse.

This can be seen as still in the realm of first-order logic, in that sense that the second-order system can be translated into a first-order system conserving provability.  This is how second-order arithmetic is defined.\r\n\r\nAll the theorems of the Henkin semantics will be ""theorems"" in the first."	"74be3cdc-ce32-4d96-8090-9c8680e13407"	"325"	"738"	""	""	""

So k|(n-1)! and k congruent 1 (mod n). This means k needs to divide 1. So n must be prime (or 1, but we can eliminate this by substitution).\r\n\r\n**(n-1)! congruent -1 if n is prime**\r\n\r\nWikipedia contains [two proofs][1] of this result known as Wilson's theorem. The first proof only uses basic abstract algebra and so should be understandable with a good knowledge of modular arithmetic. Just in case, I prove below that each element `1, 2, ... n-1` has a unique inverse `mod n`.\r\n\r\nThey use the fact that integers `mod p` form a group and hence that each element `x not congruent 0` has a multiplicative inverse (a number y such that `xy congruent 1 (mod n)`.\r\nWe show this as follows. Suppose `n not | x`, for `n` prime. From the uniqueness of prime factorisations, `xn` is the first product of `x`, after `0x`, divisible by `n` (use prime factorisation theorem). If we look at the series `kn` in `mod n`, this cycles and must have cycle length `n`. Therefore, each element `x, 2x,... nx` must be different modulo `n`, including one, `y`, with `xy congruent 1 mod n`. Furthermore, due to the cycle length being `n`, each only one of those elements will be an inverse. So every element has a unique inverse (although 1 and -1 are their own inverses).\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem#Proofs"	"f7231490-fe62-4e34-9096-8b29d9e92136"	"308"	"742"	"added 51 characters in body"	""	""

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. \r\n\r\nWhy's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\\prod (x+\\zeta_p^i) = z^p$ for $\\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$.  So if $p>3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).\r\n\r\nLame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these ""generalized integers"" $Z[\\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this [article][1], Dedekind was the first to define a ring.\r\n\r\nThe article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html"	"484ff91f-3ede-469b-8f22-60e80a3f2115"	"363"	"837"	""	""	""

The negative sign makes combinatorial proofs difficult, so let's rearrange this as\r\n\r\nf(n) + f(n-2) = 4f(n-1).\r\n\r\nThen you want to show that the number of n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is four times the number of (n-1)-tilings. (An ""n-tiling"" is a tiling of a 3 by 2n rectangle by dominoes.)\r\n\r\nIn bijective terms, then, we want a bijection between the set of n-tilings and (n-2)-tilings and the set of (n-1)-tilings, where the (n-1)-tilings are each tagged with the number 1, 2, 3, or 4.\r\n\r\nGiven an (n-1)-tiling, there are three ""obvious"" ways to obtain an n-tiling from it, namely by adding one of the three 1-tilings on the right end.  These generate tilings which have a vertical line passing all the way through,  two units from the right end; call these ""faulted"" tilings, and those which don't have a vertical line in that position ""faultless"".  \r\nSo it suffices to show that the number of faultless n-tilings, plus the number of (n-2)-tilings, is the number of (n-1)-tilings.  It's easy to see that the number of faultless n-tilings is 2g(n-2); a faultless tilings must have a horizontal domino covering the second and third squares from the right in some row, and this assumption forces the placement of some other dominoes.  So we need 2g(n-2) + f(n-2) = f(n-1).  Shifting the indices, we need 2g(n-1) + f(n-1) = f(n), which you have already said is true.\r\n\r\n"	"37e4ab2d-3a97-44c3-b331-c6b441e8e211"	"367"	"848"	""	""	""

Placing this circle wholly inside of another region of known area, preferably by inscribing it in a square of side length 2, then we have a ratio of the circle's area to the total area of the square  (in this example that ratio is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$).  \r\n\r\nThe Monte Carlo method works by approximating areas based on the ratio of the number of sample points lying within our region of interest and the total number of sample points we choose to try.  If we spread a uniformly distributed sequence of $N$ points over our square of area 4, and call the number of points that land inside of the inscribed circle $p$, then we can say $\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{p}{N}$.  \r\n\r\nMy implementation of this in Matlab requires tens of thousands of test points to achieve 3.14159xxxx, but I have not tried it for low-discrepancy sequences, or any other uniformly distributed point sets.

"2010-07-21T20:28:20.760"	"2"	"26"	"The question is more profound than is initially seems, and is really about algebraic structures. The first question you have to ask yourself is *where you're working*:\r\n\r\nIn general, addition and multiplication are defined on a *structure*, which in this case  is a *set* (basically a collection of ""things"") with two *operators* we call *addition* (marked +) and *multiplication* (marked \xb7 or \xd7 or * or whatever). If this structure holds some properties, which are sometimes called *axioms*, then it is called a [ring][1]. The properties are:\r\n\r\n1. The set is closed under the operator +. That is, if a and b are in G, then a+b is also in G.\r\n2. The set has a member which we mark as 0. It has the properties that for every a in G, a+0 = 0 and 0+a = 0.\r\n3. The operation + is commutative: a+b = b+a.\r\n4. The operation + is associative: (a+b)+c = a+(b+c).\r\n5. Every member has an additive inverse: for every a in G there is some b such that a+b = 0 (we mark b as -a).\r\n6. The set is closed under the operator *. That is, if a and b are in G, then a*b is also in G.\r\n7. The set has a member which we mark as 1. It has the properties that for every a in G, a*1 = a and 1*a = a.\r\n8. The operation * is associative: (a*b) * c = a * (b*c).\r\n9. Multiplication is distributive over addition: a * (b+c) = a*b + a*c and (a+b) * c = a*b + a*c.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a long list, and introduces the operator + which is not even explicitly mentioned in the question, these properties are quite natural. For example, the integers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} we all know and love indeed form a ring. The real numbers also form a ring  (in fact they form a [field][2], which means they hold even more properties).\r\n\r\nIn regard to your question, the identity x * 1 = x (I assume that's what you meant) is in fact an axiom - it is axiom 7. However, the other two identities are results of the other axioms:\r\n\r\n**First identity:** We use axioms 2 and 9 to get\r\n\r\n0 * x = (0+0) * x = 0*x + 0*x\r\n\r\nand then by adding -(0*x) (the additive inverse of 0*x, from axiom 5) to both sides,\r\n\r\n0 = 0*x\r\n\r\n**Second identity:** As stated in axiom 5, -(-x) is just to notation used which means ""the additive inverse of -x"". To show that -(-x) = x we need to show that x is in fact the additive inverse of -x, or in other words that x + -x = 0 and -x + x = 0. But that's just what axiom 5 says, so we're done.\r\n\r\nLast point: You might be wondering why did we have to go and introduce addition to answer a question about multiplication? Well, it so happens that without addition the other two identities are simply not true. For example, if we look at the positive integers {1, 2, 3, ...} with only multiplication, then there is no 0 there! Simply put, this is because the positive integers do not form a ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_%28mathematics%29"	"86d93717-ea0a-4850-a771-0c06736b18de"	"379"	"882"	""	""	""

Basically, a fair bit of ring theory was developed for algebraic number theory.  This in turn was because people were trying to prove Fermat's last theorem. \r\n\r\nWhy's this? Let $p$ be a prime. Then the equation $x^p + y^p = z^p$ can be written as $\\prod (x+\\zeta_p^iy) = z^p$ for $\\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$th root of unity.  All these quantities are elements of the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$.  So if $p>3$ and there is unique factorization in the ring $Z[\\zeta_p]$, it isn't terribly hard to show that this is impossible at least in the basic case where $p $ does not divide $xyz$ (and can be found, for instance, in Borevich-Shafarevich's book on number theory).\r\n\r\nLame actually thought he had a proof of FLT via this argument. But he was wrong: these rings generally don't admit unique factorization.  So, it became a problem to study these ""generalized integers"" $Z[\\zeta_p]$, which of course are basic examples of rings.  It wasn't until Dedekind that the right notion of unique factorization -- namely, factorization of ideals -- was found. In fact, the case of FLT I just mentioned generalizes to the case where $p$ does not divide the class number of $Z[\\zeta_p]$ (the class number is the invariant that measures how far it is from being a UFD).  And, according to this [article][1], Dedekind was the first to define a ring.\r\n\r\nThe article I linked to, incidentally, has a fair bit of additional interesting history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Ring_theory.html"	"658e1620-4558-47ad-aa91-e90477c3e4f1"	"363"	"907"	"added 1 characters in body"	""	""

The first mathematical breakthrough, numbers, came about when people realized that if you just forgot about whether it was 5 cows + 3 cows, or 5 rocks + 3 rocks or whatever you always got 8.  Numbers are what you get when you look at collections of objects and *forget what kind of object they are*.\r\n\r\nWhen you say ""as sets"" you mean you're forgetting a lot of information, in particular you don't care about what the names of the elements in that set are or what properties those elements have.

Depending on how you want to measure ""size of a subset of the natural numbers"" they might be different sizes.  For example, a common way to measure ""size of a subset of the natural numbers"" is by its ""density.""  That is you look at the first N numbers and calculate what fraction of them are in your set, and then take the limit as N goes to infinity (warning for sufficiently complicated sets this limit might not exist).

Indeed, a ""pole"" on the boundary would only make sense if you can analytically continue the power series to some proper domain containing the disk $D_R(0)$, and this is generally impossible. For instance, the power series $\\sum z^{2^j}$ cannot be continued in any way outside the unit disk, because it is unbounded along any ray whose angle is a dyadic fraction.  The unit circle is its natural boundary, though it does not make sense to say that the function has a branch point or pole there.

Then near $p$, we can write $f$ as $q$ basically something linear plus some ""noise"" which ""doesn't matter"" (i.e. is little oh of the distance to $p$).

(Where the righthand exponent t denotes the matrix transpose).\r\n\r\nNote: When we present linear operators by their matrices, composition of linear transformations becomes matrix multiplication, and evaluation at a vector $\\vec{w}$ becomes righthand multiplication by a column matrix.\r\n\r\nThe main point is that coordinates _obscure_ what's actually going on here.
