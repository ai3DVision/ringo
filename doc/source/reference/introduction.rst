This document is a reference guide to Snap.py functionality.

Snap.py is a Python interface for SNAP. SNAP is a general purpose,
high performance system for analysis and manipulation of large networks.
SNAP is written in C++ and optimized for maximum performance and
compact graph representation. It easily scales to massive networks
with hundreds of millions of nodes, and billions of edges.

Snap.py provides performance benefits of SNAP, combined with flexibility
of Python. Most of the SNAP functionality is available via Snap.py in Python.

To use Snap.py in Python, import the **snap** module:

>>> import snap

The code in this document assumes that Snap.py has been imported as shown above.
