Proposed Features

- port Ringo to Mac Os X 10.11.3
- Add the iterator methods Nodes() and Edges() to the reference text
- Remove AddNode(NodeI) from the reference text
- Convenience methods for graph density and for reversing a directed graph
  (I took a look at the C++ version manual and they don't exist there either)
- A python egg to be able to install the module locally (like with
  easy_install --user with pypi packages)
