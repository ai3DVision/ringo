Proposed Features
Apr 21, 2014

- Add the iterator methods Nodes() and Edges() to the reference text

- Remove AddNode(NodeI) from the reference text

- Convenience methods for graph density and for reversing a directed graph
  (I took a look at the C++ version manual and they don't exist there either)

- A python egg to be able to install the module locally (like with
  easy_install --user with pypi packages)
